Our work is primarily carried out at two main units - the Counselling or Crisis Intervention Unit and the Rehabilitation Centre. At these centres, primary interventions as well as community-based and preventive initiatives are carried out. Below is a brief write up about our various programmes: Crisis Intervention: This Unit provides free and confidential psycho-social counselling for a wide spectrum of emotional distress and mental health problems, ranging from self esteem issues, inter-personal problems, depression, suicide, substance abuse and severe mental disorders. Our trained volunteer counsellors carry out this counselling. Rehabilitation Centre: This pioneering programme, which works towards the rehabilitation of persons suffering from chronic schizophrenia, has become a module that is being replicated by many other institutions. It is a full day therapeutic facility, which uses therapy at the group, individual and family levels. Referral Service: Through extensive networking with other organizations, we have built up a huge referral service. Equipped with this, we help our clients to get legal, medical or other specialized help, as required by them. Community Outreach Programme: Over the years, the sustained efforts of our ongoing Community Outreach initiatives have been directed towards the goal of destigmatizing counselling by raising the awareness of the community about different aspects of emotional and mental health and the help available. Basic Counselling Skills Course: This annually conducted workshop equips helpers in the community such as teachers, doctors and counselors with skills not only to make them better helper but also helps them to build more awareness of self which further leads to better relationship. In recognition of our contribution to society, Sanjivini has been honoured with the Sanskriti Award for 1982 and the Delhi Government award for valuable services rendered in 1998.","DELHI,","Health & Family Welfare,Any Other,","DELHI->New Delhi,",Delhi,Registered Societies (Non-Government),DELHI,,231650204,Registrar of Societies,S/4671,"Sanjivini Society for Mental Health, A-6, Satsang Vihar Marg, Qutab Institutional Area, New Delhi - 110067",Sanjivini Society for Mental Health,04-06-1971,Societies Act XXI of 1860,,,,,Meera Trehan,Chairperson@sanjivinisociety.org,9911939833,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ladakh Institute of Prevention,,9419179847,JK/2016/0111845,1982-260063,lipladakh@gmail.com,,"Brief report on the activities of Ladakh institute of prevention (LIP) Health of the high altitude population of Ladakh and those coming to work in this region need special care and attention. Protection is required from the additional hypoxic conditions resulting from environmental pollution, Occupational related diseases, life style related diseases due to acculturization and high altitude related diseases. LIP over the years have carried out detailed epidemiological studies on these subjects and applied interventions to safeguard the population’s health and environment. LIP’s contribution towards environmental health: Through its action on smoking and health it has been able to reduce prevalence of smoking in adult male from 42 % in 1988 to 8% in 2010. This intervention has reduced incidence of acute coronary artery disease and lung cancer. Through our clinical, epidemiological, radiological, environmental and histo-pathological study, we identified mixed dust pneumoconiosis (Silicosis and coal worker’s type of pneumoconiosis) in the Indus belt population of Ladakh (Thorax 1991;46;341-343) and domestic pollution and respiratory illness in the Himalayan population (International Journal of epidemiology 1991;vol20;No3;749-757). The intervention practiced following it has improved the respiratory health of the population. LIP’s contribution in screening of the population in life style related diseases (Non-communicable diseases and cancer) During the last thirty years, Leh town have been colonized by rural people representing most of the villages of Ladakh. These population are now adopting a western model of life style threatening an impending disease of the new millennium. LIP did an extensive study (comprehensive health camp with service provision and health awareness campaign) in all the subdivisions of Ladakh on the prevalence of Non-communicable diseases from 2007-2011. The results on Prevalence of hypertension and diabetes have been published in BMJ open (2015;5:e007026) and (BMJ open;2016;6:e009728). Based on these works, LIP has distributed booklet and CD (in local language) on living “Healthy life style”. LIP’s works on screening of HBsAg (hepatitis B) in over 5000 subjects throughout the district has enlightened the population in getting the hepatitis B (HBsAg) negative subjects to receive full course of vaccine. Those with carriers of hepatitis B are being followed up and those needing anti-viral treatment are being supported by LIP. This activity will certainly reduce cancer of the liver. Through its medical and health awareness interventions the prevalence of stomach cancer has been reduced from 25 per one lakh population in 1997 to 8-10 per one lakh at present. Deficiency diseases in rural Ladakh. For the last five years, Lip’s health camps have focused on deficiency disease like Iron deficiency anemia, Vitamin D insufficiency, micro and macronutrient status in rural population of Ladakh. It has used validated questionnaires and hematological and biochemical assays (Hb, PBF; serum ferritin, Vitamin B12, folic acid, TSH) to determine the nutritional status particularly in Zanskar subdivision. Service provision and health education done simultaneously is proving effective in ameliorating these problems. Mother and child health. LIP is currently trying to establish “mother and child health care through a mother and child health handbook system” wherein the health of the mother from the first day of antenatal check-up to 9 months post pregnancy and the child from birth till 6 year will be documented in the hand book. We have so far documented 3000 mother and child under this system. High altitude adaptation. LIP is currently studying prevalence of chronic mountain sickness (CMS) in populations living at higher altitude (≥ 3800 meters). This study will help not only to understand the factors leading to loss of adaptation (CMS) but also hypoxia related diseases like Dementia, cancers, lung and heart diseases. Previous work on adaptation and maladaptation have been published in PLoS one (June 2008 vol 3 issue6/e2342.)","LADAKH,","Health & Family Welfare,","LADAKH->Leh(Ladakh),",Leh,Other Registered Entities (Non-Government),LADAKH,,152710047,Registrar of Societies,53 UTL OF 2021,"Dr. Tsering Norboo SecretaryLadakh Institute of Prevention Dambuchan, Leh-Ladakh 194101",Ladakh Institute of Prevention,25-02-2021,Society Registration Act XXI of 1860,,,,,,,,Tsering Norboo,norboonsn@yahoo.com,9419178711,,,,,,,,,,Tundup Tsewang,tondupt@yahoo.co.in,9419179025

Vijayan Pavamani, our founder, and his wife Premila Pavamani, our current Director, began their work to befriend the lonely in crisis, from the veranda of a small cottage that was their home. The Calcutta Samaritans is a registered, secular, autonomous and voluntary organisation. We have now been able to befriend a much wider range of persons with special needs. From the suicidal to the substance abuser through treatment and rehabilitation; from those at risk of STD’s and AIDS to a larger group NGOs being trained in drug awareness and de-addiction; The Calcutta Samaritans has honed in to the marginalized for which the organization campaigns and advocates. The organization has grown beyond all expectation with over 150 Samaritans working day and night to ease pain, loneliness and suffering. Rev. Pavamani believed that those who came to us were not ‘cases’, or numbers, but persons in need, who needed to be cared for, and “the person more important than their problems”. By personal example in his lifetime, Rev. Vijayan Pavamani focused on the individual; proving that it is not the work itself, but the manner in which one does the work that is important. This is the work ethic that we have adopted. We strive to, quite simply, be there for those who come to us. The vision: The Calcutta Samaritans’ vision is a community that affirms the dignity and self-worth of the individual and ensures their holistic empowerment. The mission: We are a movement of people working to improve the quality of life of individuals in society: By listening, befriending and counseling through education, healthcare and advocacy, rehabilitation, self-scheme projects and job-skills development for the upliftment of the community. The following are the projects/departments of the organization: • Awareness Assistance and Counselling Centre for substance abuse • De-addiction centre supported by MSJE at Kolkata and Jamshedpur • Long term rehabilitation and aftercare centre for substance abusers • Targeted intervention for IDUs and FSWs supported SACS • Regional Resource and Training Centre supported by MSJE • Campaign and advocacy supported by Actionaid • Vocational rehabilitation & job skills training centre • Work place prevention programmes in Kolkata and at Jamshedpur • Pathological laboratory","WEST BENGAL, testingswss, WEST BENGAL,","Health & Family Welfare,HIV/AIDS,Human Rights,Legal Awareness & Aid,Micro Finance (SHGs),Nutrition,Right to Information & Advocacy,Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Vocational Training,Women's Development & Empowerment,","WEST BENGAL->Birbhum, testingswss->, WEST BENGAL->North Twenty Four Parganas, Puruliya, South Twenty Four Parganas, Kolkata,",Kolkata,Registered Societies (Non-Government),WEST BENGAL,,147120136,Registrar of Societies,S/18582 of 1976-1977,"48,Ripon Street Kolkata-700 016",The Calcutta Samaritans,01-11-1976,WEST BENGAL ACT XXVI of 1961,,,,,,,,Ketaki Dutt Paul,keyadutt@gmail.com,9830261282,,,,,,,,,,PROBHITA PAVAMANI SHEW,probhita@gmail.com,8408051607

The NGO in its current avatar and even before incorporation as Society have touched multitude of issues on poverty alleviation and basic human rights. Our approach has been need based and towards a long lasting solution. In the past we had opportunities to participate in national exhibitions as partner and reaped in all benefits to showcase the talents possessed by artisans and handicraft workers. Introducing unknown talents to national level platforms and scope for improvisation gives us the sense of accomplishments which we wish to replicate as far as possible. We are successfully running library cum resource centres in remote villages of Darbhanga, Madhubani and Bettiah district of Bihar. Over 5000 children and teachers have benefited from this initiative and its our desire to add more teeth and scale the model elsewhere. Awareness and sensitization programs on myriad of issues like environment, deforestation, health ailments , road safety, natural and manmade disasters, panchayati raj institutions, rights and entitlements of people specifically the vulnerable sections like women, children and people suffering on stratification blues owing to their caste, creed and religion. These awareness drives have yielded results on many fronts and of late we have been receiving requests from schools and educational institutions to carry out the awareness drive on issues concerning their pupil. We have noticed a remarkable change in the attitude of the people as far as their health seeking is concerned. The realization that diseases and sufferings are not curse of the nature and has nothing to do with past karma is something our organization has professed right from inception. In this regard Family Counselling Centers and Counselors have been roped in Bihar and Delhi to pledge a effective intervention. Death of resources notwithstanding we have supporting primary school children of SC community in Bettiah in their educational pursuits and attainment of holistic development. The project has benefited over 1000 children in last three years. We have successfully arranged excursion tours, provided toys and stationery, gift items and have conducted workshops on art and craft, diya making, decorative items etc. In the past we have successfully organized seminar on Conflict Reporting in India in collaboration with Jamia University. Notable journalists and academics participated in the seminar to discuss the burning issue of resolving conflicts all over the world and how should media report in such crisis situation. It’s the common man who suffers the most if conflict erupts. The event was eye opener for us also as it showed us the true picture of contrasting life before and after the manmade disasters. We have successfully organized cultural events and fests to promote culture of Mithilanchal and spread the need to preserve traditions and dialects. The contributions of great sons of Mithila have been highlighted by our talks, speeches and panel discussions in schools and meetings.
