It has completed over 70 study projects, the details of which are available on its website. Most of the research projects undertaken have been sponsored by different ministries of Government of India or international agencies. These generally have dealt with national and state policies oriented issues related to management and development of water resources, rural development and poverty alleviation, environmental preservation, disaster management, gender studies and socio-economic development. A majority of the studies have involved conduct of large scale socio-economic field surveys resulting in collection of primary data. Such surveys have been conducted in almost all parts of India. The studies have also enabled the Institute to gain considerable experience of interaction with government machinery at the central, state, district levels and below. The findings and suggestions of these studies are available in the reports submitted to the respective sponsoring agencies. Conducting training programmes for senior government officers has been another activity of the Institute. Several such programmes including those for senior IAS officers have been conducted. Details provided on the Institute’s website. These were one or two weeks programmes dealing mostly with optimum utilization of resources veering around economic and environmental analysis of major development projects. Most of the training programmes have been sponsored by the respective ministries of Government of India. The institute has played an active part in organizing international, national as well as state level seminars and conferences on important policy related issues (Details on its website). The most notable among these has been the International Conference on Sustainable Development of Water Resources, in 2000. These have been organized in Delhi as well as in other parts of the country and have generally been sponsored by different ministries of Government of India, State Governments, International and other agencies. These seminars and conferences have been well attended with the right mix of participation from government, academic institutions and NGOs depending upon the context and have come forward with very useful recommendations. Institution building has also been an important activity specially in the earlier years. The Institute established a spacious office complex of its own with all the requisite facilities such as office and staff rooms, computer rooms, library, seminar hall, computers, LCD projector etc. located in a well connected institutional area and surrounded by a host of public institutions. Allotment of land for the same was got approved by Delhi Development Authority while, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, agreed to our request to provide a major grant for construction of the office complex. The Institute also succeeded in getting 80G sanctioned by the Income Tax Authorities. The Institute established a rich library which can be used by outside scholars, professionals and students also. Since 2002,the Institute has also set up a study centre for BCA students within its office complex sponsored by Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). This centre is equipped with 30 desktop computers and other facilities.",,"Agriculture,Disaster Management,Drinking Water,Environment & Forests,Labour & Employment,Land Resources,Micro Small & Medium Enterprises,New & Renewable Energy,Nutrition,Panchayati Raj,Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Tribal Affairs,Urban Development & Poverty Alleviation,Water Resources,Women's Development & Empowerment,",,Delhi,Registered Societies (Non-Government),DELHI,,231650501,Registrar of Societies,S/13222,"2-B, Institutional Area, Karkardooma, Delhi-110092",Institute for Resource Management and Economic Development,27-01-1983,"Societies Registration Act, XXI of 1860",,,,,Kamta Prasad,irmed7@gmail.com,9810288036,Sudhir Kumar Jain,skjain51@hotmail.com,9810211681,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their parents are rag pickers, sewage workers, quarry labourers, house maids and without intervention they will go on to those same careers trapped in a cycle of poverty reinforced by barriers of class, education and geography. Every year we take twelve girls and twelve boys at the age of four for admisssion and our total enrollment is three hundred and fifty students. The Shanti Bhavan Educational Trust offers free high quality education for its students both at its residential school and subsequently at top tier college. we follow the ICSE and ISC curriculum a challenging set of quidelines and examinations usually reserved for elite preparatory schools. Our Students are given the skills and education to compete and excel at the very highest of levels. Shanti Bhavan is more than a school. It is a unique approach for educating poor children. Our commitment goes beyond education. In addition to their academics our children are treated to a program of complete holistic care carefully structured to teach them about arts,sports,leadership and world cultures. we provide complete medical and residential services to each child offering them the kind of environment they need to flourish. In total this is a seventeen to nineteen years of intense intervention per child from age four to twenty three. Our model has shown that by providing children with the tools to succeed at a very high level and by instilling in them the values of civic engagement that they then become change makers themselves going on to help their families,communities and other children in need. It takes just that one generation to break the cycle of poverty for these families. No other model of educational intervention commits the same level of long term and quality investment in the lives of children or holds more promise for their futures and those of their families. All children in the first nine batches of tenth graders passed ICSE examination in first class with majority of them getting distinctions. The seven batches that have graduated from twelfth grade in the ISC examination have also received first class and distinction. These children are studying in colleges of excellence including National law school Bangalore and Kolkata, Christ College, Mount Carmel College, Reva Univeristy, BMS Institute of Technology. Four batches of our students who graduated with Bachelor Degrees are working in multinational companies such as Goldman Sachs, Capgemini, Mercedes Benz, Deloitte, Infosys, Amazon, Yahoo, ANZ Grindlays etc.","TAMIL NADU,","Children,Education & Literacy,Nutrition,","TAMIL NADU->Krishnagiri,",Bangalore,Trust (Non-Government),KARNATAKA,,094421630,Sub-Registrar,INR-4-00391-2011-12,"No 502, 5th C Main 5th cross 2nd block HRBR layout Kalyana Nagar 560 043India",Shanti Bhavan Educational Trust,13-02-2012,"The Registration Act, 1908",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Giving focus to the issues like health, women empowerment, education, environment, gender equity, micro finance SYS has reached to the people of every sphere of the society. From its inception it has been working in carrying out with different kinds of government and non-government projects. At present SYS has developed a platform in the name of Shanti Tapoban Ashram which is established in a beautiful natural atmosphere. This stunning atmosphere of Shanti Tapoban Ashram draws its attention to the people from many dimensions. In this campus there are three wings named Matruchhaya (Swadhar Shelter Home), Banaprastha (Old Age Home) and Mahila Talim Pathshala. Matruchhaya since its conception of 2009 has placed itself as a notable foundation for women’s empowerment in this district. As the name reflects to mother’s shade it has proved to be a stage where the women from difficult circumstances are provided with shelter and are rehabilitated successfully. It has drawn its attention to its beautiful environment where the women are engaged with different kinds of developmental activities. Here they are not only provided with shelter and proper care but also they are given different types of trainings like broom making, candle making, paper bag making, tailoring and teaching related to women empowerment, spiritual and moral values, yoga, pranayam etc. In this atmosphere the necessity of a family life which is the bond of love and affection is also taught to the inmates. There is Amar Hendshel Baer-in regional language (kitchen garden) is developed with the active involvement of the inmates where many kinds of vegetables are cropped according to the season. Matruchhaya’s contribution to the field of women empowerment is well acknowledged by the government and other agencies located in the district as well in the state. It has reached to the women living in the stage of distress and showed them the appropriate path for their future betterment. At present 47 numbers of inmates with 5 numbers of children are staying in this shelter home. The depressed individuals who are deserted from their so called civilized offspring are looked after with proper care, love and belongingness in the Banaprastha. SYS has formed a platform for the elderly mass named Baristha Nagarik Sangha which is engaged for the welfare of the elderly. Since 2012 the International Elderly Day is celebrated in the campus of Ashram and created a distinguished set up in the state. Mahila Talim Pathshala is a platform where the girls and women from nearby villages as well as from all over the district are given vocational training. Besides it they are also provided with the teaching related to social service, spirituality (Srimad Bhagbat Geeta), promotion of Ayurveda, women’s security law etc. SYS seeks support from the private donations to run the Banaprastha (Old Age Home) and Mahila Talim Pathshala. The support from the District Red Cross Society to the Mahila Talim Pathshala is one of the notable views in this regard. There are 10 inmates staying in this home and 20 numbers of students are the part of the Mahila Talim Pathshala. Many programs are held in the natural atmosphere of Shanti Tapoban Ashram with gathering of the people from different facets. The program named Jagruti Divas which is organized here in every Sankranti of the month drag attention of the public from different parts of Odisha state. Besides these 18 numbers of festivals including the national events and regional cultural fests are also part of it.

Combating exploitation of child labour, slavery, sale of child sexual abuse, domestic violence. Under domestic and inter national laws and work for their education, training and rehabilitation Health The goal of the SPECTRA As health programme is to achieve sustainable improvements in health status among vulnerable groups, especially the geographically remote, women of childbearing age and children under five. Health is more then health care, while the SPECTRA work the strengthen health systems and services, it also promotes initiatives that offer people the knowledge and skills to avoid illness. These measures include educating women and girls and enabling families to adopt appropriate hygiene practices. In addition, the SPECTRA supports testing and implementation of income-generating strategies that allow households and communities to acquire better nutrition and health status. Increased income enables communities to improve nutritional status, particularly that of women and children, and to build and maintain water and sanitation systems. Education  A major goal of the SPECTRA is to improve the quality of basic education. Four objectives set the wider agenda: ensuring better early caring and learning environments for young children; increasing access to education; keeping children in school longer; and raising levels of academic achievement. In common with other donor agencies, the SPECTRA intend those girls, the very poor, and geographically remote populations should receive special attention. Of the may factors, that influences the quality of basis education. SPECTRA education portfolio is distinctive in one other respect. It interprets’ basis education’ as the continuation of learning which stretches from birth to adolescence. In developing countries, the young children and the family portfolio is experimenting in both rural and urban settings with various community-based approaches that enhance early childcare and education opportunities, A common concern across most of these projects is the quality of experience received as a child moves from home to early childhood development settings to primary school. Rural Development The SPECTRA is committed to reducing rural poverty, particularly in resource-poor, degraded or remote environments. It concentrates on a small number of programms of significant sale. The model of participatory rural development it has pioneered combines a set of common development principles with the flexibility to respond to specific contexts and needs. Programmes typically link elements such as rural savings and credit, natural resource management, productive infrastructure development, increased agricultural productivity and human skill development with a central concern for community-level participation and decision-making. The ultimate goal is to enable community members to make informed choices from a range of appropriate options for sustainable and equitable development. A central strategy has been to crate or strengthen an institutional structure at the village level through which people can determine priority needs decide how best to manage common resources in the interests of the community as a whole. Whether, broad-based or task-specific, these village organizations’ also serve to represent the community to the government and two other development partners, including NGOs and the private sector. Social capital built at the local level provides a supportive environment for enlarging the economic assets of a community and for harnessing individual self-interest to generate income growth in a equitable and sustainable manner. Assets are typically built through community management of neutral resources-water storage, irrigation infrastructure, soil conservation or forestry – or the construction of basic economic infrastructure, such as rural roads or agricultural storage facilities. Income growth is promoted by increasing agricultural productivity through improved farming methods, input supply, marketing, land development and management reform or by increasing off-farm income and supporting enterprise development. Local capital is mobilized by promoting savings and development financial services to enable broad access to credit on a sustainable basis. Training programme support the effectiveness and sustainability of the village-level institutions by providing the management and technical skills needed to plan, implement and maintain local development activities. The SPECTRA is committed to building the knowledge base in rural development through learning, analyzing and disseminating lessons learners from field experience. Community Participation The benefits of community participation in development programme have been richly demonstrated. Local people can acquire the organized capacity to define and meet common needs on a sustainable basis. Each year the range of problems poor communities’ address through participatory efforts grows – as does the SPECTRAs understanding of what is needed to champion local initiative. Full participation comes most quickly when there are immediate, tangible benefits from community action. Projects that bring economic rewards, for instance, move forward faster than those aimed solely at preventing health problems. As community organizations created for economic benefit mature, however, they gain the confidence and vision to address longer-term social needs successfully. The potential of these groups is vast. Support organizations need to listen carefully. Community groups want to be heard, to be offered choices, to have central roles in project management and a genuine stake in the outcome. As the Foundation monitors community initiatives in different cultural and geographical settings, it is learning what combinations of these factors bring maximum social and economic benefits over time. It is also learning the limits to the effectiveness of community participation, Experience shows, for example, that small enterprises are beat run by individuals or partners rather than community organizations. Gender and Development The SPECTRAs is committed to highlighting the essential role of women in the development process and to facilitating their participation. Research and experience have shown that considering gender considerations in planning economic and social interventions greatly increases the probability of their success. In most countries and communities, gender determines both domestic and productive roles. Women generally have responsibilities for both, but their ability to contribute to society is constrained by social, cultural and political traditions. Compared to men, they tend to be less educated, more limited in their options and paid less. Yet women manage households, raise children, pass knowledge to the next generation, lend livestock, grew, and process crops and often run businesses to supplement family income. Families and communities benefit exponentially when women reap greater rewards for their own efforts and labor. Once sustenance needs are covered, women quickly address the health and education needs of other generations. To raise the competence and confidence of women – and, correspondingly, to open the thinking of men-is a long term commitment of the SPECTRAs. In addition to supporting research and action aimed at making women’s participation a reality, the SPECTRAs support women with village credit schemes, training in forestry, masonry , crop and livestock management accounting and marketing. It encourages education and careers for women. It looks for ways to engage with men around the attitudinal and structural changes that flow from programmesthat benefit women. The Environment In resource-poor areas, people and the environment are often trapped together in a downward spiral. Penury of natural resources forces the less privileged to consume the few resources available to them. The result is deeper poverty deplaned soils, deforested hills, polluted water, disease, and despair. The Spectra’s rural development programms combine local organization, appropriate technology, and investment in efforts to reverse this destructive course. Health, education and capacity development programmes also help to raise awareness of environmental issues and encourage people to manage to change in the best interests of the community. The environment includes natural, built and cultural factors that cut across virtually all development programmes. Each profoundly, affects the human conditions, and all are interrelated, Environmental problems are complex and often extremely difficult to slove. Even the smallest steps in the right direction have positive implications for rich and poor alike.

Shram Sadhana Amravati,,9420715864,MH/2016/0106625,721-2580606,pc_kvka@yahoo.co.in,,"Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Durgapur, Dist. Amravati has been established in July,1995 with the responsibilities to bring forth agricultural vis-a vis rural development in the area through its mandated activities on training, front line demonstrations and on farm testing/adaptive trials. Ever since it became functional in the year 1996, it has made several innovative interventions in the agricultural development process of the district. Shram Sadhana, Amravati being a pioneer voluntary organization in the field of women and child development and water conservation work, the major focus was to develop the villages facing acute shortage of irrigation water to fulfill the minimum requirements of the farmers. Keeping this aspect in view, KVK applied its efforts to develop rain water harvesting models. KVK has introduced various water conservation models such as small farm ponds, Gabbian structures, Wanrai bandhara, and low cost rain water harvesting structures benefitting 158 farmers from Isambri village. The model developed by KVK as part of demonstrating rain water harvesting technologies has become a living example and it is replicated by State Department of Agriculture as “Isambri Model” after the name of the village where 441 TCM rain water was harvested by using all water conservation structures. Development of farming system module for rainfed farmers, sustainable dry land agriculture, in-situ soil and water conservation practices to increase productivity in rainfed conditions, up-gradation of local goat by Usmanabadi buck are only few of the numerous contributions made by the kendra within a short span of time. KVK focused its directions towards Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in cotton and chickpea with the concept of block demonstrations. The villages namely Kohala Jateshwar, Nimbhora, Pala, Kajana, Khartalegaon, Sawarkhed, Kumagarh, Lehgaon, etc. are developed as IPM villages. This technology is being practiced on more than 500 ha of area in these villages and diffusion of technology is observed in every village of the district. The average cost of cultivation of IPM farmer reduced to ` 6300 per acre as compared to ` 7900 per acre before IPM with 28 per cent increase in productivity. Application of chemical pesticide sprays have been reduced to 2 to 3 as compared to 8 to 10 before IPM. More than 45 per cent increase in net income is observed in IPM trained farmers. Now, the KVK is identified as a resource centre for IPM technology particularly in cotton, chickpea, soybean and Nagpur Mandarin. Krishi Vigyan Kendra has also established a Model Farm to disseminate and demonstrate the agro techniques suitable to the local farming community in the district for sustainable development. This model farm, equipped with modern irrigation system has important horticultural crops like guava, sweet Nagpur Mandarin, Nagpur Mandarin, sapota, custard apple and mango developed on 4 ha area to cater to the need of farmers in the district. Out of the total land 6 ha is utilized for crop production purpose like crop cafeteria, seed production, technology demonstrations, farm trials, etc. Fodder crops are cultivated on 1 ha area and teak is planted on 0.80 ha land. The instructional farm also acts as a technology assessment centre before their transfer to the farmers of the operational area. The training cum demonstration units like nursery, fruit and vegetable processing, vermicomposting, bio-agents and biopesticide production, mushroom cultivation, spawn production, soybean processing, Information and communication technology with video conferencing facility and animal production are established to meet the training need of farmers and in order to supply the required quality material to them. The facilities for Soil and Water testing, Phyto diagnostic, Post Harvest Technology Laboratory and an Agricultural Technology Information Centre is available with the KVK. Facility for Nagpur Mandarin rootstock DNA testing is unique contribution of the KVK developed for Nagpur Mandarin growing farmers of the area. As a Village Agriculture Knowledge Hub, KVK adopted 7 villages in Amravati district to facilitate the farmers about market information, weather information, disease information at the village level. The KVK acts as a vocational training centre to work at the grass root level for imparting need-based training and skills in the field of agriculture and rural development. KVK has offered trainings to 22430 participants by conducting 787 training programmes for its cliental with the help of its multidisciplinary team. 288 on farm trials are conducted for assessment and refinement of the recent agricultural technologies. Front line demonstrations are conducted on 1166 ha area covering 2232 farmers and in animal science 144 animals covering 144 farmers, in agriculture engineering frontline demonstrations conducted on farm implements on 143 ha area covering 196 farmers. With extension activities like Field days, Exhibitions, Kisan Mela, Diagnostic visits, Advisory services, Video Conferencing etc. KVK covered 2,17,947 farmers of the area. Helpline services and mobile messaging services are started by the KVK benefitting 9400 farmers. In order to improve the socio-economic situation of the women in agriculture and for drudgery reduction 345 women self help groups are formed. KVK has formed 142 farmers club at village level to identify and communicate their problems related to agriculture and allied activities. KVK frequently organizes meetings for interaction between scientists and farmers. This has led to increased productivity and overall output of the village and has made a concrete difference to the standard of living of the villagers. The growth of this KVK has been steady and relatively faster because, besides the support of the ICAR, it has financial as well as administrative linkages and support of the Govt. KVK is fully functional in its operational area with record achievements and has bagged award of excellence for best work done under ATMA project.

Since 1976 the organization has been working relentlessly in implementing the policies of National Leprosy Eradication Programme and assisting the Government in its endeavor. Besides the activity related to diagnosis and treatment of patients, the Project has been carrying out Operational and Technical Research in the field of leprosy and has published over 350 scientific papers in Indian and International journals. The efforts of BLP have been highly recognized for its excellence in Leprosy research. Over the years though the prevalence of leprosy has come down with the implementation of Multi Drug Treatment (MDT) strategy, the problem of leprosy patients with clinical problems and disability caused by nerve damage still remains a huge challenge before the nation today. To address this issue, BLP has also been running Prevention and care of deformity (POD) care and services programme in the slums of Mumbai and also in the adjoining rural areas of Thane district to persons with leprosy related disability by providing them with aids and appliances like splints, finger loops, MCR footwear, dressing kits etc under the guidance of Physiotherapists and paramedical workers. BLP has also been practicing Integrated Rehabilitation programme to eliminate the stigma associated with the disease and fighting for human rights of persons afflicted with leprosy and other related diseases leading to disabilities for nearly four decades. Some of the achievements….. Undaunted by various odds, BLP has forged ahead in its mission and goals 1.Reached 1.95 million people of which 60% are from slums of Dharavi and other similar slums in G and H wards of Mumbai 2.35,000 patients have been cured with MDT. 3.Disabilities have been prevented in more than 3000 patients. 4.300 leprosy patients and physically challenged persons have been benefitted under this programme Our extensive studies and experience in Mumbai and adjoining rural areas from where patients travel quite a long distance to avail medical relief, clearly indicates the need for strengthening the Main Leprosy Referral Centre and satellite clinics to be equipped with experienced manpower and expertise with skills and necessary resources. These clinics are mainly integrated in the Govt Hospitals and municipal dispensaries and hospitals. We are therefore making every effort to further strengthen the existing Referral Centre and satellite clinics as this will help to improve the quality of services and also sustain clinical services to patients affected with leprosy. The Referral Centre is thronged by leprosy patients referred not only from Mumbai but also from adjoining districts of Thane, Raigad and other places of Maharashtra.","MAHARASHTRA,","Any Other,","MAHARASHTRA->Mumbai,",Mumbai,Trust (Non-Government),MAHARASHTRA,,083780218,Charity Commissioner,F-4158(Mum),Bombay Leprosy Project Vidnyan Bhavan11 V.N Purav MargSion - Chunabhatti Mumbai 400022 Maharashtra,Bombay Leprosy Project,06-10-1976,Bombay Public Trusts Act 1951,,Bharat Govind Goyal,bggoyal63@gmail.com,9820011241,,,,Vivek Vasudev Pai,bombayleprosy@gmail.com,9967944004,,,,,,,,,,Narayan Balakrishna Iyer ,idfmumbai@gmail.com,9819131388

The core of our Work is demonstrative love. Our belief is that deep healing only takes place if a creature feels safe, cared for, and loved. When we first opened in 2007, there were over 5,000 homeless dogs and the stray population was out of control. With no small animal vet within 75 kms, no treatment facility, rabies, and widespread abuse, there was unbounded misery. There were perhaps 350 suffering and dying animals on the streets / mostly dogs and puppies, but monkeys, cows, and others, too. It was one of the worst situations I have seen. Today, it is very different. The most important thing that has happened is that the relationship between the homeless animals and the people amongst whom they live day in, day out has been transformed. And the lives of these creatures has been profoundly uplifted. One can experience the change by walking on the streets. Each year, street conditions get better and better, and Tiruvannamalai is perhaps the only municipality of size in the Nation where this has happened. The Animal Welfare Board of India in a public letter of endorsement has said, we are one of the very best in the Nation. We have 7 major programs. A sterilization/anti-rabies program. A clinic. Hospital facilities. Sanctuary, if an animal cannot make it on its own. And adoption program. 24/7 emergency rescue. Hospice. Since opening we have sterilized 6,296 dogs. Given 11,933 anti-rabies injections. Had 36,108 visits to our clinic. Given 102,548 in-patient treatments. Had 3,652 emergency rescues. Found good homes for 844 puppies/dogs. Treated 3,259 animals other than dogs. Our mission is to lift suffering from the Animal Realm. We will treat any animal in need. Large. Small. Wild. Domestic.

Instead of rendering advisory services alone, the Council since its inception, in 1985, has been taking up issues affecting them through the consumer courts and other means and feels proud to have provided relief to crores of people. These include: *Remedial action against short-filling of LPG in cooking gas refills; 184 Bottling Plants, of the 3 Oil Marketing Companies (IOCL, BPCL & HPCL), which were the root cause of the short-filling of LPG in the cooking gas refills have been automated, at a cost of about Rs. 300 crores, by the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals. The quantified loss of nearly Rs. 750 crores per year to the consumers, across the country has been taken care by this upgradation. This was due to the Original Petition of the Council, initiated in 2001, before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC); *Won an important case against the Rourkela Development Authority and secured financial relief for a group of individuals, against violation of Plan and Specifications in the construction of the houses and delay in handing over the possession; *Obtained a separate District Forum for Rourkela, though it is not the district headquarters, which otherwise necessitated the entire Rourkela population to approach the Forum, situated at Sundergarh, a place 100 kms. away; *Rerouting of Dhanbad-Alleppey Express Train through Chennai Central; *Campaigned against non-transferring of Excise Duty concessions (to the consumers) extended by the Union government to the industry; *Better upkeep of the Railway coaches of Utkal Kalinga Express and other trains; *Reintroduction of Ac Chair Car in Ispat Express and elimination of unfair trade practice by the SE Railway; *Refunding of Booking Advance by M/s LML and APSL; and *many more. To educate the consumers and create an awareness, the Council has been publishing its monthly, ADVANTAGE CONSUMER, for the last 28 years. Its website www.advantageconsumer.com, with a collection of important consumer dispute judgements of the National Commission and the Apex Court, has been serving the consumers, for the past 16 years, as a store house of information as to how the Consumer Protection Act can help the common man to redress his grievances. The Chief Mentor, has been answering and guiding the consumers across the country, FREE OF COST, ever since the website of the Council became operational in March 2000. The Council has redressed over 1500 individual complaints, through its own ADR mechanism. The innovative approach of the Council, whether it be putting up huge sign-boards (way back in 1989), to educate the consumers, or filing ever class action complaint in the State Commission, Orissa, (LML and APSL cases, 1989), have remained trail blazers for others to follow.

Friends of Tribals Society,http://www.ftsindia.com,9748040644,WB/2016/0110936,033-24544510,ftsho.office@ekal.org,,"Friends of Tribals Society (FTS) was established in 1989 at Kolkata by some eminent philanthropists with the object of all-round development of tribals in our country. Following Swami Vivekanand’s dictum ‘Where the child cannot come to the school, the school must go to the child’ the founding members of FTS started the concept of One Teacher Schools (Ekal Vidyalalya) wherein a teacher, usually an educated young person from the village, teaches about 25-30 children of class 1, 2 and 3. These informal schools are conducted for three hours every day and apart from elementary education the children are also imparted basic health training including yoga and exercise and knowledge of Indian culture and heritage and handicrafts etc. Training of these teachers is also done once every month and for five days every six months. As on September 30, 2016 FTS along with its associate organizations were running 52453 schools in the remote villages across the country and FTS alone was running 29463 schools. Monitoring of running of these schools is done by an intricate system of administration at state, district and sub district level and the data on running and working of the schools in centrally collected at the society’s head office and analysed every month. With time and in keeping with the changing needs of the times, FTS has also expanded the scope of its work in the villages. Under Awareness Education, they discuss various issues for benefit of the village like eradication of alcoholism, settlement of their mutual issues and the government schemes for the benefit of the villagers.This programme creates a very healthy atmosphere in the village. Whenever necessary, FTS sewabratis help them in filing application under Right to Information Act. (RTI). Moreover the scope of education was expanded not only to include health and hygiene but also development education. Under development education the villagers are encouraged to produce fertilizer from cow dung and Pesticides from cow urine. The children of FTS schools are encouraged to plant at least one sapling each year. These are normally planted in and around the houses of the villagers so that they can take care of the sapling and also become owner of the trees. This also develops a creative attitude among children. Impact of FTS’ work: Due to the various activities run by FTS in the villages there is improvement in the state of education both for the children and the guardians. The villagers are gradually leading a more hygienic life, their financial condition is improving on account of various development activities. They are also getting rid of addiction to alcohol and the most important aspect is that with inculcation of moral values they also develop dedication to Mother Bharat.","ANDHRA PRADESH, ARUNACHAL PRADESH, ASSAM, CHHATTISGARH, GUJARAT, JHARKHAND, KARNATAKA, KERALA,","Children,Education & Literacy,Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Tribal Affairs,","ANDHRA PRADESH->Visakhapatnam, Kurnool, Chittoor, ARUNACHAL PRADESH->East Kameng, ASSAM->Kokrajhar, Morigaon, Nagaon, Sivasagar, CHHATTISGARH->Raigarh, Korba , Rajnandgaon, GUJARAT->Patan , Kheda, Dohad , Tapi, JHARKHAND->Chatra, Kodarma, Palamu, Hazaribagh, KARNATAKA->Bidar, KERALA->Wayanad,",Kolkata,Registered Societies (Non-Government),WEST BENGAL,,147120473,Registrar of Societies,S/62039 of 1989-1990,"Ekal Bhawan, 123/A Harish Mukherjee Road, Kolkata -700026",Friends of Tribals Society,06-06-1989,West Bengal Societies Registration Act 1961,,Sajan Kumar Bansal,cmd@skipperlimited.com,9830006766,,,,Ramesh Kumar Maheshwari,ca.ramesh1956@gmail.com,9830023345,Rakesh Jhunjhunwala,rakesh@radhaelectricals.com,9903377029,,,,,,,,,

Everyday evening classes are held for them so as to educate them atleast that much so that they are able to take a small but respectable job for themselves. The income that we receive is spent mainly on salaries of employees and consultants, developmental costs, maintenance, depreciation of furniture, electricity, the teaching learning materials that are bought for children etc. Some Umeed kids have been integrated in highly reputed mainstream schools like The Heritage, G D Goenka, DAV Public School , HDFC School, DPS and Adharshila The SAACAR unit children are taught vocational skills to lead an independent life.

Our work is primarily carried out at two main units - the Counselling or Crisis Intervention Unit and the Rehabilitation Centre. At these centres, primary interventions as well as community-based and preventive initiatives are carried out. Below is a brief write up about our various programmes: Crisis Intervention: This Unit provides free and confidential psycho-social counselling for a wide spectrum of emotional distress and mental health problems, ranging from self esteem issues, inter-personal problems, depression, suicide, substance abuse and severe mental disorders. Our trained volunteer counsellors carry out this counselling. Rehabilitation Centre: This pioneering programme, which works towards the rehabilitation of persons suffering from chronic schizophrenia, has become a module that is being replicated by many other institutions. It is a full day therapeutic facility, which uses therapy at the group, individual and family levels. Referral Service: Through extensive networking with other organizations, we have built up a huge referral service. Equipped with this, we help our clients to get legal, medical or other specialized help, as required by them. Community Outreach Programme: Over the years, the sustained efforts of our ongoing Community Outreach initiatives have been directed towards the goal of destigmatizing counselling by raising the awareness of the community about different aspects of emotional and mental health and the help available. Basic Counselling Skills Course: This annually conducted workshop equips helpers in the community such as teachers, doctors and counselors with skills not only to make them better helper but also helps them to build more awareness of self which further leads to better relationship. In recognition of our contribution to society, Sanjivini has been honoured with the Sanskriti Award for 1982 and the Delhi Government award for valuable services rendered in 1998.","DELHI,","Health & Family Welfare,Any Other,","DELHI->New Delhi,",Delhi,Registered Societies (Non-Government),DELHI,,231650204,Registrar of Societies,S/4671,"Sanjivini Society for Mental Health, A-6, Satsang Vihar Marg, Qutab Institutional Area, New Delhi - 110067",Sanjivini Society for Mental Health,04-06-1971,Societies Act XXI of 1860,,,,,Meera Trehan,Chairperson@sanjivinisociety.org,9911939833,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rural Area Development Trust,http://,9842158918,TN/2016/0112041,04546-281543,ruadt2009@yahoo.in,,"BACKGROUND OF THE ORGANISATION: The Rural Area Development Trust (RUADT) is a voluntary social service organization exclusively working for the rehabilitation of differently-abled people. It was set up in the village of B. Dharmathupatti in 1991, with the mission of identifying needy differently-abled chil-dren in the surrounding areas (around 10 villages) through awareness about disability and its implications for affected families and individuals. RUADT started its work with only 17 physically challenged children in 1996 (91-93 done basic survey in the Bodi Block and 93 –96 formation of women community and creating aware-ness about woman rights), providing basic amenities like foods, clothes, free medical treatment, transport, physiotherapy, and surgery. All these services were provided on, the surveyed need basis and are aimed at enabling the children to participate in community life and attend formal schooling. In 1997, RUADT started the Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Programme for per-sons with disabilities in rural areas. The programme was supported by German Doctor’s Commit-tee, Germany from 1997 to 2001, where 217 differently-abled persons (persons with disabili-ties including differently-abled children) were benefited by the CBR programme. An additional 619 individuals and their families were reached in another 28 villages with support from the CBR Forum, Bangalore. In 1999, the Miriam Dean Trust, U.K supported the RUADT’s differently-abled children programme, to which a programme for mentally challenged and Spastic Cerebral Palsy children was added, that included a strong focus on parents’ participation. In 2002, RUADT implemented the NPRPD (CBR) programme for the Department of Disa-bled Rehabilitation of the Government of Tamil Nadu in Bodinayakanur Block of Theni District. One MRW (Multi Rehabilitation Worker), 50 CBR employees, and 2,525 people with disabilities were involved in this programme. In 2004, we implemented a Day Care Centre at Uthamapalayam named Manjari Day Care Centre. The programme was supported by Nandri help for South India, Switzerland Home based rehabilitation programme was also supported by Nandri which opened doors for about 60 chil-dren. In 2005, Kamarajar Day Care centre was established to identify the children aged 0- 6 years affected by brain damage and growth retardation. After identifying the children, the EIC Rehabilitation treatment plan was discussed with our rehabilitation professionals according to the impairment. The treatment of Early Intervention centre includes Physiotherapy, Occupa-tional therapy, Special Education, Sensory integration and Play Therapy. In 2008, we replaced Kamarajar Day Care Centre to Pushparani Children’s Village which became permanent now. The Early intervention centre capacitates 50 – 65 children. The thera-py treatments, food and transportation charges are provided free of cost. Now the centre is elevated to special school and vocational training centre. Rural Area Development Trust is emerging to become a strong foundation with the help of our Board of Governors, reliable Donors, dedicated rehabilitation professionals, Caretakers, Well-wishers’ and Parents.

Providing qualitative nationalistic education through 16 nos of coeducational schools in 10 districts of Arunachal Pradesh. These schools are located in remote interior villages of Arunachal Pradesh with low access to quality education In these schools, activities for the integrated development of the five aspects (five koshas) of human personality through the five core areas of Sharirik (Physical), Yog, Sanskrit, Sangeet (Music) and Naitik –Adhyatmik (Moral & Spiritual ) Education are effectively carried out. 2. Running 9 (nine) numbers of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs) in 2 (two) districts of Siang and East Siang districts of Arunachal Pradesh. These schools are exclusively residential and free Schools for girls under SSA aimed universalisation of elementary education. These 9 KGBVs run by Arunachal Shiksha Vikas Samti have evolved to be the best and model schools among the government projects in Arunachal Pradesh because of its quality education program in the lines of Vidya Bharati as well as the vocational and specific skill development programs conducted in these schools. 3. Providing academic and allied support to 5 (five) nos of Associated Schools in 3 districts of Upper Subansiri, Changlang and Namsai. Though directly not managed by the Samiti, these schools also follow the quality educational programs (scholastic and co-scholastic) of Vidya Bharati and bring out qualitative outcomes. The local management bodies of these schools are getting expertise regarding school administration from the Arunachal Shiksha Vikas Samiti. 4. Regularly organizing teacher’s quality enhancement programs like Teachers’ Training, workshops, etc. Arunachal Shiksha Vikas Samiti conducts Teachers Training camps of 10 day duration with at least 50 – 60 teachers every year. Through these training camps, the Samiti imparts training to teachers in the areas of qualitative teaching learning methods, effective ways of evaluation, preparation of low cost/ no cost teaching aids, etc. More than 500 teachers have been effectively trained through these camps so far. 5. Annually organizing inter school sports, Science fests, literary and cultural competitions, Band Training, Personality Development camps, etc for students. In these separate events sports competitions like races, jumps (long jump & high jump), shot put and discus throw, games like kabaddi, volley ball, tug of war, archery etc are conducted and the hidden talents in those areas are traced and promoted. In the Science Fests under the Akhil Bharatiya Vigyan Mela scheme of Vidya Bharati, competitions among students are conducted at school level, cluster level and state level in the areas of science experimentation, exhibition, paper presentation, science quiz etc and the winners are awarded with prizes and promoted for higher level competitions. Similar efforts are being made through the Kala and Sanskritik Melas, etc in the respective fields. 6. Promotion of Girls Education has been one of the key areas of attention for the Vidya Bharati and Arunachal Shiksha Vikas Samiti as well. The Samiti has been following the Balika Shiksha karyakram of the Vidya Bharati in true spirit and organizing special programs like Balika Shivir (Girls’ Convention) Exhibition of Vocational and craft items prepared by girl students under the intervention of Balika Shiksha (Girls Education). Balika Sabhas and Matri Bharatis (Mothers’Councils) etc in the all schools. 7.

Besides research and teaching, the Centre provides comprehensive clinical services for a range of genetic disorders and inborn errors of metabolism. During the past few years the Centre’s scientists and clinical geneticists have provided diagnostic and counselling services to over 15,000 families with genetic disorders. With generous assistance from the Government of Karnataka, the Centre provides these services free of cost to BPL families seen at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health and other government-funded hospitals. The Centre conducts intensive short-term courses and training programmes in human disease genetics which routinely attract young scientists and clinicians from across the country. The Centre has been assisting medical colleges in several district headquarters in Karnataka to set up their own basic facilities for diagnosis and management of the more common genetic disorders. The Centre’s scientists are also engaged in developing low-cost strategies for diagnosis and therapy suitable for local requirements. Under its ‘Public Engagement with Genetics’ programme, CHG provides assistance to parent support groups for families with genetic disorders. CHG is involved in improving public awareness of the ethical, legal and societal issues surrounding advances in human genome research. The Centre is located in a 20-acre institutional area within a 80-acre Biotech Park being developed by the Government of Karnataka in Electronics City in south Bangalore. IBAB, an institution specializing in Bioinformatics, and a Bio-IT Centre promoted jointly by the Ministry of IT, Government of India and the Government of Karnataka are next door. The Centre for Human Genetics is an academic partner in the Bio-IT Centre, which is equipped with NGS platforms. BBC, the Bangalore Bioinnovation Centre, is located behind CHG’s laboratories. There are two health universities and several major hospitals in south Bangalore, among them NIMHANS, St. Johns and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Heath. There is also a “Health City” coming up nearby, which includes Narayana Hrudayalaya and the new Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Center. CHG’s present location therefore provides obvious advantages for postgraduate teaching and research in Human Genetics. A post-doctoral Fellowship programme in Paediatric Genetics is being conducted by the Centre in collaboration with the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health. The Centre offers a two-year Master’s degree programme in Human Disease Genetics under the aegis of Mysore University. The latter is a blend of formal teaching, laboratory exercises, case studies and activity-based learning. It provides hands-on training in human genetics via a combination of cell and molecular biology, genetics and clinical biology, including the use of statistical techniques.

I enjoyed the wonderful opportunity of working with several distinguished and committed persons, whose support and contribution have largely been responsible in steering the society out of woods and to bring the Society to the present level. Organizing the 25th APWSS Conference at Hyderabad during October, 2016 was of course a key achievement and a personal high point in my career. As you are well aware, the 25th APWSS Conference had many firsts to its credit. It brought us much needed credibility and international recognition to ISWS. It was a huge financial success too. The Society today is in a very strong financial position and could be counted among the top few professional societies in agriculture. Thanks to a large number of our sponsors and other stakeholders, who made this happen. The other achievements of the present EC include, introduction of new guidelines for the ISWS Awards, supporting ISWS State units for organizing local events, creating a corpus to provide travel support for students to attend conferences, supporting young scientists for participation at the International conferences held abroad etc. I took personal interest in getting the website redesigned with many unique user-friendly features. One such feature is the online Directory of members. I request members to update their profile periodically to make it more dynamic and useful. The on-going electronic voting for the election of office bearers of the Society for the year 2017-18 is perhaps the first such attempt for any professional society in the country. This saves time, money and more importantly is transparent and prevents bogus voting. I am sure this will find many followers in NARS. Our persistent efforts towards improving the timeliness and the quality of the Journal have given rich dividends. The handsome rating the Indian Journal of Weed Science got recently from NAAS is a testimony to this. Coming at the end of our tenure, this indeed 2 is icing on the cake. I acknowledge the efforts of the Editorial team led by Dr. Sushilkumar for this accomplishment. If there is one person who could be singled out for the overall success, it is undoubtedly Dr. A.R. Sharma, the Secretary of the Society. I applaud him for his selfless and committed service to the Society. I lay down my office as President of ISWS with utmost satisfaction and many happy memories. I am sure the new Team which will take over the reins soon, will do everything at their command to keep the ISWS flag flying high.

It has been performed in Orissa for centuries by young boys, who dress as women to praise Jagannath and Krishna. The dance is executed by a group of boys who perform acrobatic figures inspired by the life of Radha and Krishna. The boys begin to learn the dance at an early age until adolescence, when their androgynous appearance changes. In the Odia language Gotipua, means ""single boy”. Long ago, the temples in Orissa had female dancers known as devadasi (or mahari), who were devoted to Lord Jagannath, which gave rise to Mahari dance. Sculptures of dancers on bas-reliefs in temples in Orissa like Konark Sun temple and Jagannath Temples (Puri) demonstrate this ancient tradition. With the decline of mahari dancers around the 15th century during the reign of Rama Chandra Dev (who founded the Bhoi dynasty), boy dancers known as Gotipua in Orissa continued the tradition. Gotipua dance is a Guru Sisya Parampara system. Today Gotipua dance will be performed by “Guru Maguni Jena Nrutya Parisad, Puri” in which Guru Sri Maguni Jena himself will perform along with his disciples. Under the able supervision of Guru Sri Maguni Jena young boys are given education and trained to become Gotipua dancers and taken care with food and shelter in his Gurukula. Guru Sri Maguni Jena is a disciple of Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra , Guru ramachandra barik, and Guru padmanabha das. He is training Gotipua dancers since last 20 years and trained more than 200 gotipua dancers.

Theatre lovers of the city and outside were gradually becoming aware of the meaningful job being done there. At Lee Road, Sansthan housed books, magazines, audio and video recordings, photographs, models of outstanding sets, masks, rare books and materials, Seminars, discussions and talks were regularly organized to record various aspects of histrionics on a pan-Indian level. Sansthans journey reached a milestone when the Government of West Bengal leased 9 cottahs of land to Upchar Trust where Sansthan built Natya Bhavan to continue its activities. In 1996,Girish Karnad, the noted playwright and actor laid the foundation stone of Natya Bhavan. Sri Buddhadev Bhattacharjee, the then Deputy Chief Minister, Govt. of West Bengal inaugurated the new building in 2000, constructed with financial aid from Upchar Trust, the Government of India, Government of West Bengal, Ford Foundation, Trusts and individuals. The year 2006 saw the Sansthan celebrating its Silver Jubilee and the institution has since then moved on to gradually become a research and information centre, documenting the growth and present trends of Indian theatre. Sections in the Archive- 1. Library and Cover-file (Records) with reading room facilities, 2. Audio Library, 3. Video Library, 4. Photograph Library, 5. Research and Publication Section. Heritage Library - Sansthan has set up a Heritage Library, based on the premise that theatre-studies need to be located in the broader canvas of the heritage/history of multiple disciplines of Anthropology, Astronomy, Astrology, Archaeology, Architecture, Culture, Geo-politics, Geography History, Literature, Philosophy, Religion, Sociology, the Arts, both visual and performing etc. With cultural-history being regarded as a rich source of understanding the heritage and the cultural tradition of a country, materials stored in an archive may be made use of in the fullest possible way from a spectators point of view. The Sansthan is setting up a Theatre Museum at Natya Bhavan with financial aid from the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, Under the Museum Grant Scheme.","WEST BENGAL,","Art & Culture,","WEST BENGAL->Kolkata,",Kolkata,Registered Societies (Non-Government),WEST BENGAL,,,Registrar of Societies,S/76992 of 1994-1995,"EE-8, Sector-II, Bidhannagar, Kolkata-700 091",NATYA SHODH SANSTHAN,01-06-1994,XXVI of 1961,,,,,,,,YAMA SHROFF,yamashroff@gmail.com,9339537225,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the focus was on introduction of Honey production as an income generating activity, gradually the society began to marshal resources and skills to promote production of Honey in the region. It managed to acquire some land in the industrial area of Almora and constructed a building with its own resources giving enough space to open office and set up a Honey processing plant, which happens to be first of its kind in the entire Uttarakhand with processing capacity of 250 Kg honey per shift. It was designed by Mr Deep Chandra Bisht, the founder of the organization. Actually, he replicated the design, which he saw in Perth, Australia during his Navy days. He was so fascinated by the design that he was determined to replicate it in Almora. Gradually, Society started giving training to the villagers especially women on bee keeping and has successfully trained thousands of people in the region. They are practicing bee keeping and producing honey which is significantly adding to their income leading to socio-economic development of the region. Now with the continuous efforts the society has diversified in different fields like formation and promotion of Self Help Groups, formation of Farmers clubs, formation of Joint Liability groups with the kind support of NABARD etc. Society has become partner of National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development and for last 4-5 years has been conducting Entrepreneurship Skill Development Programmes based on different trades like computer hardware and software, Food Processing, Fruit Preservation, carpentry, Fashion Designing, Beautician and Cosmetology etc. Hundreds of unemployed people have been trained on such skills and as a result many of them have taken up entrepreneurship as their career option. Society is providing them help and guidance to set up their enterprise and is all set to coordinate with different departments for providing the potential entrepreneurs know how about schemes meant for self-employment/ entrepreneurship. It has well established links with Khadi Village and Industries Commission (KVIC), the nodal agency for Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP); District Industries Centre (DIC); Khadi and Village Industries Board and different nationalized banks. Society has formed Farmer Clubs comprising progressive farmers of the different development blocks of district Almora, Uttarakhand, with the kind support from National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Through farmer clubs many activities like rain water harvesting, organic farming, wild fire extinguishing, awareness programmes on soil health, personal hygiene, sanitation, garbage management and against child marriage, child abuse, sexual harassment of children, human trafficking, child labour etc are being taken up. The society is determined to act on innovative ideas. The region was known for honey production in ancient time but the bees were reared in wall hives not in modern boxes. The Society always wants to preserve the traditional way of bee keeping, as it was developed over centuries keeping in view the climatic conditions of the region by the local people by trial and error method, and was most suitable. The society took-up a project for wall hives modification , under Ajeevika project in district Almora supported by IFAD .","UTTARAKHAND,","Children,Food Processing,Micro Finance (SHGs),Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Vocational Training,Agriculture,Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries,Art & Culture,Drinking Water,Environment & Forests,Water Resources,Women's Development & Empowerment,Any Other,","UTTARAKHAND->Almora ,",Almora,Registered Societies (Non-Government),UTTARAKHAND,,,Registrar of Societies,UK06408012020003110,"Ishwari Bhawan,Pokharkhali,Almora-263601,Uttarakhand(India)",Society For Peoples Action and Rural Development in Himalayan Area,19-04-1994,Society Act 1860,,Ramesh Chandra Upreti ,deepakbisht45@gmail.com,9410305119,,,,Deep Chandra Bisht,deepakbisht45@gmail.com,9412908089,,,,,,,,,,,,

The organization has got its establishment to materialize the dedicated and volunteer attitude of development professionals for the cause of society. Areas of Action ► Socio – economic upliftment of street and slum children. ► Capacity building and empowering the tribal and rural poor. ► Women empowerment ► Rural healthy and sanitation ► Revival of traditional health system. ► Environment protection. ► Self-employment training programme in tribal and rural areas. ► Impact assessment on development interventions COMPOSITE CENTER FOR THE SLUM AND WORKING CHILDREN Community sharing • Entire project activity shared among the slum people so that they became aware on the objectives and expected outcome of the project. • Inputs from the community and the target parents are taken for the sustainability of the project. • It was suggested in the community sharing that the targeted slum children need to be enumerated to know the overall status of the slum children. Formation of committee • A parent committee is being formed in the community. The committee sits once in a month to discuss the underlying problems and possible solutions of checking the slum children from child labour. • Discussions are also made on the issues of street children and what are the step scan be undertaken to check the vulnerability of the street children. It was also discussed in the meeting that part of the activity of the composite center of the slum children should be made for the street children. Education and Main streaming • A community school is running in the slum where 100 children are getting education. Each child is being facilitated for continuation of education. Efforts are being undertaken to mainstream the slum children into the formal education system. Vocational training programme • The vocational need and capacity is identified among the targeted children. Those are eligible to get the vocational training; they are given training on tailoring and appliqué. • Some of the children are also given training on plumbing and carpentry. • Counseling are provided to the parents of the targeted children through a psychologist/counselor of the organization regarding exploitation of children and not to engage them in the wage related activities. Health check up • Regular health checks up camps are being organized for the slum and street children in the target area. Primary treatments are provided to the children during the camp. CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAMME FOR THE PRIS It is evident that Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) are the key stakeholders in the development process of the state as well as the country. They are placed in an important place which relates the community needs with the government development programmes. Due to lack of capacity of the PRI members and interest on the part of Government officials, PRI functionaries are not able to exercise their power to a great extent. This was the finding from the workshop on PRI, which was conducted in project locations of Keonhar and Nuapara District. The participants of the workshop were the PRI functionaries, community leader and Govt. officials who provided valuable opinions on effective functioning of Panchayats in the state. TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING OF WOMEN In our recent modern society women find little or no space to assert their rights. Their situation is also more vulnerable in the context of globalization. They always fall back in realizing the ultimate outcome of every socio-economic development initiatives undertaken by different agencies. Apart from that there are number of taboos exists in the society which prevents them participate in every sphere of work and also they are not prioritized in compared to male counterparts. Looking into this background the organization has organized a mass community awareness programme on empowerment. The resource persons of the programme conveyed the message on the available entitlements for the women groups and how they can access those benefits without any sort of hurdles. Apart from this they were also oriented on the official procedure on getting those benefits. The outcome of the activity helped the women group to access the schemes implemented by different agencies. Already formed 52 Self-help groups were invited into different phases. They got trained on the book keeping mechanism and they also got the knowledge on the vocational training. There were also subjects covering the marking of the available local products. BRIDGE COURSE PROGRAMME FOR OUT-OF-SCHOOL CHILDREN With an objective to provide education to the out-of-school children, the organization has been assigned by the Govt of orissa to conduct bridge course programme in the slum areas of Bhubaneswar city. In this process, the targeted children are identified with the help of existing education committees of the slum. Thus, the organization has tried to bring the street children into limelight by providing them education, which will enhance their mental ability. At the same time awareness was created among the parents to create demand for education so that they can access basic rights of life. SOCIO-ECONOMIC SURVEY OF THE DISPLACED PERSONS The organization has undertaken a survey of the displaced persons in the nearby areas of the Dhamara port. The objective was to identify the project affected persons to get the compensation amount. The survey questions were prepared by the Dhamara Port Authority, which contained the socio-economic background of the families, their occupational status, land and other details of the target households. Thus based on this survey the authority of the Dhamara port is planning to provide identity cards for the project affected persons so that in future there will be no confusion in receiving compensation amount. CAMPAIGN ON ENVIRONMENT AWARENESS It was felt that environment protection would make the society towards sustainable development. Looking into this the organization has organized a environment awareness campaign with the school students of Bhubaneswar. Students participated in the rally organized by the organization. Leaflets were distributed to create a mass awareness among the general people. There was also a general meeting with the slum community where local resource persons delivered their views on the need for environment protection and how this will save our future generation in the context of growing industrialization. There were also representation of community level leaders, key persons such as teachers and other community members in the general meeting","ORISSA,","Children,Civic Issues,Education & Literacy,Health & Family Welfare,Panchayati Raj,Right to Information & Advocacy,Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Tribal Affairs,Urban Development & Poverty Alleviation,Women's Development & Empowerment,Youth Affairs,","ORISSA->Kalahandi, Kendujhar, Khordha , Nuapada,",Bhubaneswar,Registered Societies (Non-Government),ORISSA,,104830078,Registrar of Societies,4856/880/93,"Plot-519, Unit-III, Kharvelnagar, Back to SRIYA, Bhubaneswar, Dist: Khordha, Odisha.

Women are forced to struggle at every step to retain her professional freedom, self-respect and equality with males socially and domestically. In such circumstances this organisation is like an oasis for the downtrodden women (women’s health education and cultural development organisation). This organisation, which was started in 2003-2004 has initiated action in the direction of rescuing and developing the cultural bedrock of law and order of our country. It has formed programmes to deliver the benefit of the Government schemes for backward and downtrodden lot of all communities. It is really a tragedy that a section of the society has to supress their pains and pleasures and struggle for a morsel of food and a piece of cloth. When the founder Secretary and the office bearers of this society started searching for the cause for this, they discovered that it would definitely be possible to bring about a change in their life, if the fundamental facilities like education, employment and privileges provided by the Government. S.J.S.RY.M.C.C. Mysore is the first organisation, in collaborating with J.S.S ShramikVidyapeetha, which provided training to women who were below the poverty line in beautician course, candle making, soap oil, Phenol, preparing different food products in collaboration with CFTRI - which later became MysoreMahilaSamsthe. With the cange of name the area of activity also expanded. Going a step ahead the activities encompassed Adult Education, Tailoring training, Embroidery, Zari work, Mehendi training which inspired way for the self sufficiency of women. Change is not stagnant water. It is like a coursing river. In 2006 – 2007, as per the decision of the executive committee, and after realising that only through imparting knowledge it will be possible to bring changes in the lower strata of the society it was decided to rename the organisation as GnanaJyothiSamsthe. Through this organisation it has been creating awareness to women and men in the 65 wards laying stress on Legal education, health, domestic system, nursing and nourishing children, solid waste management, comfort centre and economic reforms of women. In recognition of this Nehru Yuva Kendra organisation has honoured this organisation by giving award. Later in 2008-2009 the Kitturu Rani Chennamma award of Karnataka Government, which is given to those who have served in the field of women’s upliftment, was given to our founder Secretary SmtHemavathi in recognition of her service. The award was conferred by the Chief Minister Sri.Yediyurappa and Sri Narendraswamy who was the Minister of Women and children development along with the cabinet members in the banquet hall of Vidhanasoudha. After this increased responsibility, the president of our organisation and other office bearers delegated the responsibility of getting the benefits given by the Government offices and expanding the field of work to the Secretary. Many politicians who watched the popularity among the masses, especially women, from close quarters tried to involve her in politics. But she chose social service over politics. Instead she formed many programmes like information about Government scheme to people, counselling, leadership awareness counselling, distribution of tailoring machine to widows, free legal aid to victims of atrocities against women, women related workshops, family counselling etc., and made GnanaJyothiSamsthe synonymous with comfort for the downtrodden women of all the 65 wards, belonging to all communities. It has given solace, avareness, aid, protest and achievement of goal which is recognised by the Suddikaigannadi newspaper which conferred ‘MysoreRatna’ and ‘MysoreNakshatra’ awards. This and the award given by Women and children welfare social welfare departments of Mysore Corporation has helped our organisation create its footprints in the city and towns. ShrimatiHemavathi was chosen as the president of Mysore District Strishakti organisation. This helped her to increase her field of opertions resulting in more stress to monetary empowerment of women, free tuition classes to failed students of SSLC with the collaboration of MysoreCity Corporation, beautician, fashion designing, Spoken English, finding market for the articles produced by women. Recognising the planning and efficiency of our secretary, she was appointed as member of the complaint redressal committee which was formed as per the order of the Supreme Court of India, by the Deputy Commissioner Sri Manivannan. The additional Magistrate Sri Betsurmat provided NanjarajaBahaddurChoultry for 7 days free of cost for creating market for the articles created by the members of the organisation. This helped to inspire women in finding market for their produce. Sri Sureshkumar Law Minister who participated in this program praised that this organisation was a role model for all organisations in the state. As a result of this many eatables were supplied to the canteens of BEML and L&T, and market was provided for the Jariwork and Jariworksarees. Loan schemes from different banks were provided. In this way GnanaJyothiSamsthe has given solace to the backward poor communities, men and women in the districts of Karnataka. This endeavour of providing solace, inspiration is inspired by many officials of the corporation, Corporation commissioner Raikar, Additional District Magistrate Sri Naganayak, several intellectuals, elders, notables and politicians. We request the continuance of their cooperation and assistance for expanding our operation of providing from the affluent to the needy in future. Likewise our organization forwards, in 2010 district welfare center coordinately Mysore allotted places to conduct spoken englingh to these place located students, and conducted about waste management awareness program in bannur town municipal council area on 2012.in the year 2013-14 got an work order about various skill development trainings from VTP Karnataka government implemented and successfully completed.

We are trying to limit the damage to Nature caused by people. We are concerned about the disappearance of forests, the depleting biodiversity, the loss of natural habitats for wild animals, the drying up of mountain springs, the pollution of rivers with sewage, non-biodegradable waste being dumped on hillsides and along pathways, the chemicals used to grow our food, public health, the loss of traditional, sustainable livelihoods and about climate change. We believe that concerted and far-sighted action is required by government and citizens together to save the Himalayan region and that youth should be the motor of that change. Our priorities are:  Organizing environment-friendly waste management;  Preventing pollution of mountain springs, streams and rivers;  Protecting bio-diversity and encouraging reforestation; and  Promoting organic farming. MANAGING WASTE We have been raising awareness and developing systems for environment-friendly solid waste management by applying the three ‘R’s - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. We are promoting segregation of waste at source, door-to-door collection of it, indoor composting of green waste, recycling of inert materials and controlled incineration of hospital and insanitary waste. We want to put a stop to littering, dumping and open burning of waste through creating awareness, offering community-based alternatives and demanding the imposition of fines on those who violate the rules. PREVENTING POLLUTION OF WATER SOURCES We have helped to clear the waste thrown into naulas, the mountain springs with which Almora was doted. With help from those who depend on these water sources, we intend to build a structure around them that keeps the water clean and makes it easily accessible. Our clean-up operations concentrate on removing waste from slopes near streams and rivers so that garbage does not wash into them during the monsoons. We demand strict enforcement of rules concerning sewage and waste water treatment and promote cost-effective ways of cleaning waste water before it enters ponds, lakes or streams. PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY We are investigating the nutritional and medicinal value of various mountain herbs and plants such as nettle with a view to multiplying and processing them as a source of livelihood for our farmers. With the help of the Department of Forests and the Indian Army Eco-Battalion, we are doing tree planting of local, broad-leafed species like oak that retain underground water and trees like kafal that provide food for birds and wild animals.

Jain Girls High School Managing Committee. Initially a school namely P.K.R. Jain Girls High School was started with a handful of girl students which at present caters to more than 2500 girls of the Ambala region, affiliated to H.B.S.E, Haryana. Encouraged by the response, the harbingers of this pious institution established another co-educational Public School, affiliated with C.B.S.E having a strength of app. 3200 students. Again our trust established one more co-educational day boarding school also affiliated with C.B.S.E having app. 1600 students and a College of Education which is a very well-known nursery of future educators in B.Ed. and M.Ed. courses. The trust works and follows the age old doctrines given by our revered Maharaj ji, “Kam Khao, Gam Khao Nam Jao”. It diligently strives to work for weakest members of the society and stresses on value education, character building and integrity in the pupils to produce complete citizens for a strong and developed nation. The group’s various achievements include many State Level as well as National Awards for the Principals & Faculty Members. This inculcates the feeling of pride in personal and group achievements. It plans the academia in such a way that the students and pupil teachers get exposure to activities that develop self-esteem and encourage lateral and creative thinking. Our institution is a perfect combination of enlightenment of soul, spiritual guidance and modern education in the present context of digitalized education. We take pride in the nationalistic spirit and instill feelings of nationalism, patriotism and work for the building up of a caring society. Along with the implementation of the education system as prescribed by the authorities, small learning communities, career academics, team teaching etc. are used for multi-disciplinary learning. It celebrates different cultural backgrounds and create systems to allow all members to showcase their potential by a plethora of activities like folk songs and folk dances, theatrics, literary quizzes and debates, cultural and annual functions etc. We also take initiatives at various levels so that various schemes being introduced by the state are intimated to all the sections of society and they get maximum benefits from them. We encourage strategies to increase academic engagement by ensuring proper teacher training, in-service opportunities and various assessment methods to meet the needs of our students. From time to time, instructional improvement workshops for faculty development in which teachers learn how to give positive instructions. The trust has completed large scale infra-structure improvement projects well in time and has very recently taken up a new project namely Charitable Medical Diagnostic Center for X-ray, Digital X-ray, MRI, Cat Scan etc. along-with modernized laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art Machinery, procured from internationally acclaimed Companies.

ATTAKKALARI PUBLIC CHARITABLE TRUST OF CONTEMPORARY  PERFORMING ARTS,http://attakkalari.org,9972950973,KL/2009/0012147,080-22123684,attakkalari.accounts@gmail.com,,"ATTAKKALARI PUBLIC CHARITABLE TRUST HO: 39_3525, KAUSTHUBHAM, MANIKKATH ROAD, RAVIPURAM, KOCHI, ERNAKULAM _ 682 016 PROJECT OFFICE: ATTAKKALARI CENTRE FOR MOVEMENT ARTS, 24-04, BTS BUS DEPOT ROAD, WILSON GARDEN, BANGALORE – 27 Attakkalari Public Charitable Trust of Contemporary Performing Arts is the only umbrella organization of its kind in India, creating a context for contemporary cultural expressions through many distinct but interlinked programs. 1. Launched in 2006, the DIPLOMA IN MOVEMENT ARTS AND MIXED MEDIA is the only programme in India that offers a full-time professional training in Contemporary Dance and allied disciplines. Currently offered as a one-year intensive, graduates may choose to continue to train and earn for a further period of two years with Attakkalari. 2. An interdisciplinary choreography lab FACETS was held in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Over the duration of the three-week residential laboratory, dancers and choreographers work with different contemporary movement techniques and Indian physical traditions and utilize existing and emerging technologies as creative tools for artistic expression. 3. Attakkalari set up the Education Outreach Programme (EOP) over six years ago to integrate the movement arts into the mainstream curriculum in schools to facilitate the holistic development of the child. Offering dance education on an unprecedented scale, Attakkalari facilitators have taught in approximately 60 schools across the economic divide and reached over 6000 children. Attakkalari conducts community dance classes every evening and also on weekends, as well as, workshops and classes for corporates and others. 4. Over the years, Attakkalari has undertaken in-depth research into the teaching methodologies in Indian performing arts traditions. The knowledge of these independent projects led to a major research project, NAGARIKA an Integrated Information System on Indian Physical Expressions through Technology. The project compiles and categorizes movement sequences of two specific Indian movement traditions –Bharatanatyam and Kalarippayattu. The interactive DVD on Bharatanatyam is ready. 5. Attakkalari’s Repertory Company has given young boys and girls, many of who are from underprivileged sections of society, a chance to earn a sustainable livelihood while pursuing their passion in the arts. Attakkalari’s productions are at the forefront of the contemporary Indian dance scene and incorporate cutting-edge digital arts, imaginative lighting and innovative music. In the last three years productions include CHRONOTOPIA, CITY ON THE MOVE, NAGARANTHARA and PURUSHARTHA. Attakkalari has performed across India, at several major European festivals, UK, Japan and is scheduled to perform in Korea also. 6. TransMedia Technologies aims to provide much needed training for designers, technicians, choreographers, dancers and actors in stage technologies. Since its inception in Bangalore, this division of Attakkalari has earned a name for itself for providing quality, cost effective services in light and sound solutions for performance groups. 8. Attakkalari India Biennial celebrates the combined visions of artists in dance, sound, digital arts and design from all over India and abroad. The recently concluded festival held from February 6th -15th brought together 300 artistes from more than 20 countries in a series of performances and related events.","ANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS,

Our main aim is to serve the poorest human beings and children by promoting social awareness and removing stigma of poverty. Besides taking up several family welfare activities, conducting medical and health camps in rural areas since past Ten years, the society is striving its best to educate women and small farmers on income generation programmes. We are making efforts to establish residential instructions with vocational courses, adult education centers, libraries for girls of rural and slum areas to sensitize the downtrodden sections of society. This could be possible due to having good rapport with government departments and local community. This organization is planning to foster secularism and harmony among people through development programmes. Our endeavour is to ensure sustainable development, harmony, peace, and make the people self-reliant. We mainly focused on awareness programme on different local issues, few are illustrated here under • Consumer awareness camp • HIV/AIDS awareness camp • Income generation training • Special camp for adolescent girls of tribal areas. • Free tailoring training • Organic farming to small farmers • Adult education programme • Literacy awareness programme • Anti Arrack campaign • Pulse Polio camp • Health and Blood camp • Nutrition food to child labour • General awareness camp • Seminar against dowry, child and widow marriages • Shields to merit students • Clean and green programme at Medaram • Free eye and medical Camp • Chickengunya prevention programme • Cultural programmes for rural youth • Note books to poor students of SC & BC hostels. This society consists of mainly social workers, small land owners and philanthropists engaged in upliftment of rural weaker sections of this mandal. The objective of protecting the just born kids thrown in dustbins, railways and bus stations etc., Freed those neglected kids by curbing education will be fulfilled if the proposed institutions are built, for which land is being procured from government. Already necessary help is extending to physically handicapped, widows, orphans and senior citizens. As a part of our aims, we are celebrating national festivals like Independence day, Republic day, Birthday celebrations of great leaders who sacrificed their lives to nation like Rajiv Gandhi and celebrated Hindidiwas fortnight pakwara on 25.09.06 and distributed prizes to the winners in examination conducted in Hindi to students of local high school. This Society has organized 150 years First War of Indian Independence celebration. The beneficiaries of our training programmes are encouraging this society to conduct such income generation courses for some other rural youth. In our training programmes, local officials and resourceful persons were assisting and delivering their valuable suggestions to participants. In a year, the society is making efforts to construct own educational institutions at Abdullapue village, R.R dist to commence full-fledged orphan center, old aged home, vocational training institute and research institute to serve more voluntarily.","TELANGANA,","Aged/Elderly,Children,Civic Issues,Differently Abled,Dalit Upliftment,Drinking Water,Education & Literacy,Environment & Forests,Health & Family Welfare,HIV/AIDS,Human Rights,Information & Communication Technology,Labour & Employment,Nutrition,Right to Information & Advocacy,Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Science & Technology,Tribal Affairs,Urban Development & Poverty Alleviation,Vocational Training,Water Resources,Women's Development & Empowerment,","TELANGANA->Rangareddy,",Hyderabad,Registered Societies (Non-Government),TELANGANA,,010220215,Registrar of Societies,9531/1999,"H.No.4-9-651 1, Plot No.37,Road No.7, V.N.C.No.160, Vinayak Nagar Colony, Hayathnagar, R.R.Dist, Telangana State PIN-501 505.",Arsha Bharathi Social Welfare Society,14-12-1999,1350 Fasil 1,,,,,P,anjaiah@arshabharathi.org,9440160139,K,kranthi@arshabharathi.org,9701897645,,,,,,,,,,,,

SNM started its work in Maharashtra’s Konkan region in 1992, and despite limited manpower and resources, successfully organized various types of conservation projects. Of the7 species of marine turtles found throughout the world, 5 are found on the Indian coast, all 5 being listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Marine turtles are also included in the Red List of IUCN. In 2002, SNM started a Marine Turtle Conservation Project for the first time in Maharashtra, in Velas in Ratnagiri district, protecting 50 Olive Ridley Turtle nests and releasing 2734 hatchlings into the sea. Over the next three years, we expanded this work to cover the entire 720 km coastline of Maharashtra. In course of the last seven years, 530 nests have been protected and over 25,000 hatchlings released into the sea. SNM has also kept up a sustained awareness campaign in Maharashtra’s coastal villages. From 2004, we have instituted the Turtle Friend Award given to individuals or organizations doing outstanding work in turtle conservation. The award includes Rs. 5000/-, a trophy and a certificate. In 2006, a booklet written by Ram Mone and Bhau Katdare, was published. This booklet was distributed free of charge to volunteers all over the coast of Maharashtra. The booklet has also been translated into Gujarati by Mr. Parthiv Sanghavi, and published in March, 2008. Marine Turtle Conservation and Awareness through Community Participation in Maharashtra, this project has been implemented in 5 coastal villages in Ratnagiri district, Maharashtra. The project was aimed at increasing community participation in marine turtle conservation, as well as developing related livelihood activities. In March 2009, a DVD in Marathi, titled Kasava Tuzyach Sathi was published. It covers the entire lifecycle of the Olive Ridley Turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)and measures for its conservation. A group of villagers in Velas have formed the Kasav Mitra Mandal to provide lodging and boarding facilities to Turtle Tourists. A small percentage of the profits derived from such Turtle Tourism is donated to a Marine Turtle Conservation Fund. This fund is utilized for Marine Turtle conservation activities in the village. Having proved to be a success at Velas, this activity is now being promoted at other Turtle Villages. Marine Turtle Knowledge Information Centre (MTKIC) An information centre focused on Marine turtles has been developed at Velas. It is housed in a 20’ x 20’ shed where the entire lifecycle of Marine Turtles has been displayed on panels using photographs and detailed information. The Centre may be visited free of charge. Study of the White-rumped Vulture The White-rumped Vulture (Gyps bengalensis), classified as critically endangered by IUCN, has suffered a 95 % population decline in India. Use of Diclofenac in the veterinary sector, low breeding success and food scarcity have been identified as the main causes. While monitoring a nesting colony over a 3 year period, we observed many instances of false incubation, possibly resulting from food shortage. We also found that the relatively new practice of burying livestock carcasses was leading to unavailability of an important source of carrion for the vultures. We arranged to feed the vultures in the nesting colony at Anjarla in an attempt to overcome both these threats. This experiment yielded positive results, with false incubation declining from 45 % to 13 % while the breeding success increased from 16 % to 40 %. Prevention of Indian Swiftlet Nest Robbery in India In 2001, SNM uncovered an international smuggling racket involving nests of the Indian Swiftlet (Collocalia unicolor) from Vengurla Rocks, an island about 20 km off the shore of Vengurla in Sindhudurg district. The nest robbery was stopped with the help of the Forest Department. Our sustained efforts thereafter led to the species being included in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act. Vengurla Rocks is also a breeding ground for Terns. Overcoming various difficulties in accessing the island in monsoon, the breeding season of the terns, we managed to reach the site in June, 2001 and report authentic records regarding Tern breeding. Study of the White-bellied Sea Eagle From 1996, SNM began documentation of the endangered White-bellied Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster ) and completed a status survey in two districts of Maharashtra, discovering a total of 105 nests. Between 1996 and 2000, nests of the bird were monitored in every breeding season. In 2000, the breeding biology of this eagle was studied in detail using closed circuit cameras, this being the first time in India that such data was obtained on this species. SNM continues to work on the conservation of the White-bellied Sea Eagle. Bird Studies Realising that very little scientific data is available on most local species, we have started scientific studies of some local bird species. Valuable information on the breeding biology of 22 bird species has been collected and published. Project Mangrove (with BNHS) Mangroves, an important part of the coastal ecosystem, are under threat everywhere. This led us to start Mangrove Conservation activities. We have begun an awareness campaign on the Konkan coast with the help of the BNHS. A film show, a slide show, a photo exhibition and lectures have been organized to make coastal communities aware of the importance of mangrove forests.","MAHARASHTRA,","Environment & Forests,Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Science & Technology,Tourism,Agriculture,","MAHARASHTRA->Ratnagiri,",Chiplun,Registered Societies (Non-Government),MAHARASHTRA,,083950039,Charity Commissioner,Maharashtra-1088-Ratnagiri,"Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra, 11, United Park, Markandi,Chiplun, Tal Chiplun, Dist.- Ratnagiri, Maharashtra - 415605.",Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra,20-08-1992,Society Act 1860(21),,Vishwas Dattatray Katdare,bhaukatdare@gmail.com,9423831700,,,,Uday Sadashiv Pandit,udaypanditcpn@gmail.com,9881575033,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have keen interest in social work and they are committed to uplift women. They had understood gender inequality in society. Though legal system is trying hard to introduce various legal provisions to eradicate woes of women, yet women themselves do not know about the legal weapons they have for their safeguard. Shelter for Her Empowerment detect that awareness is power. The very name of the society refers that it is for the strength and power of women. Therefore, the society aims to educate the women and instil knowledge in to them. SHE is earnest in educating the women. The veteran teachers are toiling hard for that purpose. Slum girls and all the girls of under privilege class of society are being regularly taught. More than two hundred girls have attended our classes. English, Mathematics, Bengali and History taught. We take special care to prepare girls for career oriented course. We trained them in English conversation, computer. It has developed their communication skill. This skill is so successfully developed that already some girls have got jobs. Our girls already had trained the Potuas of Midnapore in spoken English. With the help of SHE girls, a section of Potuas are communicating in English with foreigner customers and therefore their business has shot up. SHE has assisted Girls to take up nursing training. These girls are already in employment. SHE has been performing street theatres for last five years in various places including interior slums and district. Street drama is a medium to reach out the folk in the easiest way. Our theaters deal with the social vices and their legal riddance. Dowry system, 498A, Bigamy, Female foetcide, Minor marriage etc. are few examples. Our street theatres are easily understandable, full of fun and are readily acceptable. Marginalized SHE girls are performing in the drama. Reality in their family gets expression in theatrical acts. A girl, victim of bigamy, acts in the drama. It is interesting. SHE is hugely keen to spread awareness in women. Knowledge is power. Under the influence of our street theatres, the poverty struck and socially handicapped women folk wake up to resist social vices. They protested to dowry or to surrender to social injustices and are ready to snatch their rights. We have a long list of alike case history. SHE is also a legal counseling centre. It looks after family, properly and marital problem. We have handled approximately 129 cases. On 19th March 2012 SHE has successfully organised a programme on Tagore’s Short Stories-a search for gender equality through a combination of lectures, drama, dance and song performance at Madhusudan Manch for the target audience of about 350 mostly women. The programme was highly appreciated by print and TV media. This programme was sponsored by govt. of India under TCGS to commemorate 150 years of Tagore.","WEST BENGAL, testingswss, WEST BENGAL,","Aged/Elderly,Art & Culture,Children,Civic Issues,Education & Literacy,Health & Family Welfare,Human Rights,Legal Awareness & Aid,Right to Information & Advocacy,Urban Development & Poverty Alleviation,Women's Development & Empowerment,","WEST BENGAL->Bankura , testingswss->, WEST BENGAL->Hugli , Purba Medinipur, North Twenty Four Parganas, South Twenty Four Parganas, Paschim Medinipur, Kolkata,",Kolkata,Registered Societies (Non-Government),WEST BENGAL,,147121077,Registrar of Societies,S/IL/31338,"B-258, Lake Gardens, Kolkata-700045, West Bengal, India",Shelter for Her Empowerment,19-08-2005,West Bengal Societies Registration Act XXVI of 1961,,Mini,ranjumini@yahoo.com,9830593645,,,,Ranjit Kumar Ghose,writetoranjitghose@gmail.com,9830053132,,,,,,,,,,,,

It registered in 1988 and registration number is E/2673/SURAT. Trustees are owner of Diamond Units. Basically it has been registered to help the poor people and especially to the diamond workers. Trust is working on education, health and social field. Trust is more interested to work on education, Health and Social field and HIV/AIDS field. Trust had organized advocacy meeting with industrialist and private practicenar of Surat city in previous years. Trust had also organized Bhagvat BHAGIRITHI SAPTAH to raise local fund for the benefit of PLWHA. We have been working with diamond workers under Partnership for Sexual Health Project since Nov-01 in Katargam and Ved Road area. There are 130000 diamond workers are working in Katargam and Ved road area. Diamond workers are migrated from all over the country but most of them (80%) is migrated from Saurashtra. Most of the diamond workers (68.8%) are young and the age group is 15 years to 30 years. Age group of female diamond workers is 14 years to 30 years but majority are belongs to 14 to 22 years. 60000 (46.2%) of the diamond workers are living with peer. Living with peer diamond workers are living either in KHOLI or in diamond units. Approximate 2000 are commuters. 70000 diamond workers are living with family. Due to the more profit in diamond cutting business more and more people attract towards this work. Diamond workers living far from their family so family has no control over the diamond workers and friends influence is very high and they belong to the young age group. In diamond cutting work they are working for 10 to 12 hours per day and concentration is must needed so by end of the day they look out entertainment and loving support from some one else. Due to this reason they are indulge in HRB activity. Other factors are addiction of liquor, more income, few diamond workers are unmarried and they pass the marriage age so they indulge in high risk activity to satisfy their sexual needs. Similarly, there are watchmen, boys working in video parlor and workers working in the ambrodary work who are living alone and are indulge in HRB activity. Till January 2008 we have implemented targeted intervention project under NACP-II guideline. As per the guideline of NACP – III migrant projects were stopped by GSACS from April 2008. Looking at the need of intervention with migrants we would like to request for the intervention with single male migrant under NAPC - III. Vision, Mission and Goals of the Organization:- VISION Increase the social status of the poor people by providing economic, health and other social help to different kind of people. GOALS 1. To improve the health of the poor people by accessing health related services. 2. To promote education 3. To provide other need base services to the community.",,"Health & Family Welfare,HIV/AIDS,",,surat,Trust (Non-Government),GUJARAT,,,Registrar of Societies,E/2673/SURAT 1983,"C/o. V.N.

The organization thrives to motivate and educate the most deprived members of society through its various social awareness activities.Objectives of WAIA: - The members of WAIA strongly believe that society and its future can be greatly benefited by improving the adolescents’, education, health and social environment. The youth of today are the pillar of tomorrow’s society and by providing a healthy and safe atmosphere, we, at WAIA can help to create a better world.WAIA Educate India Project- This educational based program targets both school and non-school going children. Under the Non-School Going category, children from very poor background and Our other mentoring program, which falls under the ‘School Going Category’, aims to assist school going children in preparing for subjects like Science, English and Math before their board exams. WAIA Educate India also focuses on providing healthcare to its students, who would be evaluated when joining the “Educate India Project” and during its term. This project is a “time bound” activity, with the sole purpose to take students a step forward in achieving their academic or educational goal. Under this project, WAIA aims at providing free education through mentoring, vocational training, computer training, distribution of books, providing free stationery and through sponsorship of both needful and academically excelling students. To create a positive environment, WAIA has organized mass awareness activities that focused on youth related issues like “Adolescent Awareness”. We have been conducting quiz and debate competitions which primarily targeted the youth, who are the future of tomorrow. Another focus area of our NGO (non governmental organization) is in the primary healthcare sector where the members of WAIA intend to provide increased access to healthcare facilities. We plan to educate the masses about adopting prevention measures from contagious diseases like tuberculosis, seasonal diseases like malaria, diarrhea etc. This would be conducted during the free check up clinics organized for the needy. For this, we would be utilizing mobile medical units, which is basically a fully equipped ambulance that would handle patients’ needs. The mobile medical unit would be distributing free medicines, checking blood pressure and attending to the medical needs of the poor people of the community. By this we would be covering both the preventive and curative aspects of WAIA’s health awareness ventures.",,"Aged/Elderly,Art & Culture,Children,Drinking Water,Education & Literacy,Environment & Forests,Health & Family Welfare,HIV/AIDS,Legal Awareness & Aid,Micro Small & Medium Enterprises,Nutrition,Sports,Vocational Training,Women's Development & Empowerment,Youth Affairs,",,KOLKATA,Registered Societies (Non-Government),WEST BENGAL,,147121027,Registrar of Societies,S/IL/55270,REGD.

Today, Howrah South Point is completely run by Indian administrators and social workers. Its activities are divided into 4 main programmes: -Rehabilitation of the Handicapped -Health Care -Education For The Deprived, and -Housing For The Poor Besides those main projects, 4 other programmes are run to help the aged and destitute people, to respond to the S.O.S. calls of distressed populations of West Bengal during floods or cyclones, or to provide money to HSP. For HSP, those 26 years of existence have been a fruitful co-operation with local institutions, other NGO’s, government instances, foreign donors and many well wishers. Today the organisation runs 3 formal schools, 3 non-formal schools and 3 special schools with a total strength of about 2010 students. At present we are running 8 Homes in 2 districts of West Bengal.

Urivi Vikram Charitable Trust,http://uvct.in,9818659015,DL/2009/0017783,011-28052798,dod.uvct@gmail.com,,"Urivi Vikram Charitable Trust (UVCT) - a national level NGO having functional chapters in five states in India – Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Headed by Dr UNB Rao, PhD, IPS (R), it is working for economical and social empowerment of adolescents and young adults in age group 11to 25 years. UVCT is deeply involved in all aspects relating to development of adolescents - from direct intervention by running programs to highlighting issues at policy making levels.The ‘National Centre for Adolescents’, a first of its kind in the country, established by the Trust in Dwarka, New Delhi, focuses solely on cares and concerns of adolescents. It already meets the pressing needs of adolescents by providing Psychological Counseling & Career Guidance /Workshops & Talk-shows/Seminars/ Competitions, all oriented at empowering and enabling them. Other Centers of UVCT routinely run our acclaimed programs – Shakti, Sahara, Parivartan, and Prerna etc.Project Prerna takes care of the needs of Career Guidance and Shakti provides Life Skills Eduction to underacheivers and marginalized. Shakti program was also accepted by the UN Inter Agencies Working Group July 2003 as basis for their program on Life Skills for Health Promotion of out-of-school adolescents. During the last 15 years, the Trust succeeded in counseling more than 60,000 schooled children, and assisting about 6000 out of school children, out of which about 60 percent could be put into gainful employment. The ‘National Centre for Adolescents’ is fast becoming a hub of activities related to adolescents. The National Centre played host to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, Hon’ble Former President, who participated in our ‘Foundation Day’ celebrations on 09 September 2008. Another eventful happening was the 2nd ‘Hum Kishore Festival’ - a five day Annual Meet at UVNAC in Dwarka, which we organized from 14-18 Jan 2009. The festival provided competitions in 13 disciplines participated by 19 schools. Winning Schools were awarded glittering Memorial Rolling Trophies and children got a Replica or Gold Medal and Runners-up received Silver Medals. The Trust held a National Meet in July 1999, on the theme ‘Towards a Policy for Young Adults’. The outcome of the meet was brought-out into an advocacy document for ‘National Policy for Young Adults’, which prompted the Planning Commission of India to constitute a Study Group that brought out a ‘Report on Adolescents’ (June 2001). The Min. of Youth Affairs and Sports has since launched the ‘Scheme for Development and empowerment of Adolescents’ during the current 10th Five Year Plan. UVCT deserves to be credited for finding a due place to ‘Adolescents’ in the scheme of Indian Planning. The Trust held yet another National Meet in July, 2005, on theme‘ Adolescents : Vision 2020’ in order draw the attention of the policy makers and relevant segments of the society about the challenges being faced by and opportunities available for the adolescents , in our endeavors to make India a Super Power by year 2020. The Trust brought out books titled “Teenage Blues”(in English) and “Kishoron Key Komal Duniya”(in Hindi) for the guidance of Parents, Teachers and Counselors to have a proper understanding of teenagers and their actions. Yet another publication of the Trust is “Adolescent Concerns through Own Eyes”.","ANDHRA PRADESH,","Children,Education & Literacy,Health & Family Welfare,HIV/AIDS,Prisoner's Issues,Right to Information & Advocacy,Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Urban Development & Poverty Alleviation,Vocational Training,Women's Development & Empowerment,Youth Affairs,","ANDHRA PRADESH->Visakhapatnam,",New Delhi,Registered Societies (Non-Government),DELHI,,,Registrar of Societies,26392,"UVNAC Building, HAF Pocket -1, Sector - 22, Dwarka",Urivi Vikram Charitable Trust,20-07-1994,Societies Registration Act XXI 1860,,,,,Dr,crmn.uvct@gmail.com,9818659015,Mr,sunilca1@yahoo.com,9810057560,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leadership training of tribal youth – since 2003, 20 youth (boys and girls) are being trained in our Leadership Training Centre at Sadiya, Tinsukia Dist. It is a ten month campus course, focusing on personal, social, cultural, spiritual and community development, transforming them into agents of change and transformation. 2. Probation – after the intensive training course, the youth leaders in four groups of five members each spread into 40 villages, each group covering 10 villages to complete their six-month probation period. During this field-placement the youth leaders (now known as Takars, meaning Stars) interact, eat and sleep in the villages, undertaking awareness campaigns on various social issues through street-plays, cultural songs and dances at the same time assisting formation of SHGs, JLGs , dissemination of right-based personal and social problems, organization of the village Youth Groups who are to initiate and take forward the actual work of transformation and change. This stage is followed by their vocational training, after which they are given free tools to start a business enterprise in their villages. 3. ARDA Committees – towards end of the probation period, Agency for Rural Development Action (ARDA) Committees are formed in every 10 village circle for continuity, sustainable and culturally-rooted development in areas of Agriculture, Livestock, Weaving, Health, Hygiene, Education & literature, Culture, Women & Youth and SHG. Most of their activities are related to women empowerment. It is an on-going process since 2002 such that as of date 280 villages in the 8 districts of upper Assam and 3 districts of south-east Arunachal Pradesh are under the coverage of I-CARDs developmental programmes and projects. 160 trained youth leaders–the Takars, 280 village Youth Groups, a network of TakarNets, 28 ARDA Committees and numerous village sub-groups constitute a formidable movement and unique agents of transformation that is dynamic, life-giving, sustainable and above all replicable. 4. I-CARDs well tested strategies have been internationally acclaimed by the ASHOKA FOUNDATION, based in Washington, USA – guaranteeing its ethical fiber, replicability, innovative and potency to create NATIONAL IMPACT. 5. I-CARD is one model NGO in the North East that has adequate physical infrastructure, professional manpower and vibrant presence in 11districts (8 in Assam and 3 in Arnchl Pradesh) for implementation of State /Central Govt Welfare Schemes. Students from foreign Universities are being encouraged to undertake research work on the replicability model of the developmental programmes of I-CARD. 6.

Nearly 1,600 patients are visiting our camps weekly. We have treated nearly 3,00,000 cases from April 2008 to March 2009, giving free medicines. Education about TB and Diabetics Apart from giving free medicines, we educate the tribal people about the dreaded diseases like T.B., Diabetics etc. through CD shows. This education will help them to know about the disease and the use of medicines. Consultation by Specialists – Multi Specialists Medical Camps In addition to the regular weekly camps mentioned above we conduct Special Medical Camps once in three months. In these Special Camps specialist doctors from Rajahmundry render free service to nearly 1000 patients in one day.

Since its inception it has been absolutely engaged in promoting theatre appreciation in and around Kalyani-a University city some 48 kms away from Kolkata. The organization beleives that GOOD THEATRE IS ESSENTIAL FOR GOOD LIVING. Initially it has organized 6 annual Multilingual theatre festivals in the month of November and December till 2001 in collaboration with EZCC and NANDIKAR-a Kolkata based Theatre Group. From 2002 onwards the organization has been holding a 10 day theatre festival from 17 to 26 December every year in Ritwik Sadan- a well equipped theatre auditorium in Kalyani having 994 seats. The 15th theatre festival has taken place during 17 to 26 December 2009. In the festivals- each year- a number of 15 renowned Theatre Groups from Kolkata and Districts participate.This Non-Kolkata based Theatre Festival is only of its kind in West Bengal-where not a single ticket is PUSH-SOLD. And it is also a pride to mention that almost all the shows become HOUSEFULL in this festival. That means approximately 12 to 14 thousand spectators come to the auditorium willingly during the festival days to witness 14 to 15 plays. The organization also produces play-productions-conducts seminar on theatre related issues-organizes acting workshops with the help of eminent theatre personalities. It has 8 major play-productions in its present repertoire- CHILEKOTHAR SEPAI-NOKSHI KANTHAR MAATH-ASWACHARIT-KHOWABNAMA-DASYU KENARAM-HARIYE JAY MANUSH-BABORER PRARTHANA AND MEYETI. It has also organized 2 childrens theatre workshops so far and 2 childrens plays have come out-BHALOBASI SABUJ and SINGI DESHE BUBAI TUBAI. The group also publishes an annual theatre journal NATYAMANAN and 10 Theatre Bulletins named NATUKE in the month of December.As a regular theatre group-that has an annual average of 40 stage performances- it receives Grants under various schemes from the Ministry of Culture. The organization has started to construct its own theatre building on its own 2800 sq.ft. land for which Ministry of Culture has sanctioned building grant amounting to Rs1500000. Once the long-dreamt-of-BUILDING is constructed- the organization will start INSTITUTIONALISED THEATRE ACTIVITIES specially among the children. Eminent theatre personalities like Tapas Sen-Khaled Choudhury-Rudraprasad and Swatilekha Sengupta-Goutam and Debsankar Halder-Suman Mukhopadhyay-Bratya Basu have worked in some of our play-productions. The group has travelled in all major cities in our country with its productions. It has also participated in various theatre festivals with its productions including NSD festival and Mumbai Neheru Centre festival. Almost all the performers of the group generally spend 7 hours daily for rehearsals, training and other theatre related activities. The group has 9 WHOLETIME THEATRE WORKERS. It has also a rich LIBRARY of 600+ books on THEATRE. Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra aspires to be a professional Theatre Group in near future.","WEST BENGAL,","Art & Culture,","WEST BENGAL->Nadia ,",KALYANI,Registered Societies (Non-Government),WEST BENGAL,,NIL,Registrar of Societies,S - 87325,B - 12/53 (S) GROUND FLOOR P.O: KALYANI PIN CODE : 741235,KALYANI NATYACHARCHA KENDRA,23-06-1997,WEST BENGAL ACT XXVI of 1961,,,,,PROF,sjha2007@gmail.com,9433011529,SRI,ksknck@gmail.com,9433145356,DIPTESWAR MONDAL,dipteswar@gmail.com,9332272274,,,,,,,DIBYENDU,dibkly@gmail.com,9432925939

Community Theatre Workshop,,9872032656,CH/2010/0028293,0172-4616305,asandhu_14@rediffmail.com,,"The crux of CTW’s work lies in the facilitation of dialogue within the community thru Community Theatre. The search has been for alternatives to the traditional frontal methods of communication in theatre as well as out side of it. For this purpose we have used community theater, films, the audio-visual, organized activities in community and public spaces, and used other formal and non-formal communication media to reach out to people. Theatre in Chandigarh has obviously come of age. It started as a genteel social activity and remained for long confined to schools, colleges and clubs. The pillars of society patronized it as some sort of a pretence for their `culturedness’. Through its own inner impulses, however, it evolved into a variety of forms both academic and experimental. Theatre activity remained by and large a transplanted species which refused for all the efforts and labour to get acclimatized to the environment of the synthetic city of babus and bearers, bureaucrats and liaison agents and of forbidding and cold architectural designs and cleverly segregated and dissocialized habitation. In the background of the insipid philistinism which is the hallmark of social life of Chandigarh the arrival of Community Theatre Workshop (CTW) was some sort of a happening both theatrical and social. The whole idea of a theatre which has “no time for poetry or ornate expression”, and no use of curtain sets, props, lighting or even seating arrangements was shocking. CTW believes only in the human material to crystallize the vision of “pure theatre” in which the action itself emerges as the real fact both as an image of the reality and a symbol of its under lying meaning of lack of it, our main endeavor is to break through the four walls of conventional theatre and bring the performance directly into the streets right amidst the common folk. Through this be aspire for establishing an “organic bond between the performers and the audience” so that both could join into the awaken into the social relevance of entertainment. Community Theatre Community Theatre takes theatre to a much broader plane. It is very different from the formalised theatre that we are used to seeing in the theatre halls. The accent is on free expression. We believe that every person has infinite potential and possibilities as well as a reservoir of experience within themselves. This potential and experience is a valuable learning resource. The processes of community theatre create spaces and opportunities for participants to articulate their perceptions and experience freely. Theatre activity becomes a psychological space for participants to renew and revise their self-image and to re-define for themselves, their existing roles.",,"Art & Culture,Children,Education & Literacy,Environment & Forests,Human Rights,Right to Information & Advocacy,Women's Development & Empowerment,Youth Affairs,",,Chandigarh,Registered Societies (Non-Government),CHANDIGARH,,,Registrar of Societies,2321,"305, Sector 35A, Chandigarh-160022",Community Theatre Workshop,08-07-1994,,,,,,Ira,irapande51@gmail.com,9811502881,Jaswinder,asandhu_14@rediffmail.com,9780331245,,,,,,,,,,Mandhir,mandhir13@gmail.com,9781532146

Circle Theatre,,9711341192,DL/2010/0034507,011-23512321,bapibose011@rediffmail.com,,"“Theatre is a continuous process”. Formed in 2002, Circle Theatre is meant for theatre of strength, courage and substance. Having the honour of venue opening and premired in ‘Bharat Rang Mahotsav’ (the International Theatre Festival of NSD), the USP of the organization is the volume of research oriented work of diverse subject incorporates in its productions which lead to an unique record for this organization within brief span of time in the country that, at a row all of its productions stand at par excellence in terms of its ‘artistic quality’, ‘expression’ and ‘message’ of these diverse subjects of plays produced by the organization which concerns the greater public interest (see the production list below), which result many times as ‘Best Production’ of the year of Sahitya Kala Parishad, Govt of NCT Delhi, participated in NSD’S International Theatre Festival – ‘Bharat Rang Mahotsav’ and its Satellite Theatre Festival’ including other festival of national importance etc. and finally comes to this that in the year of 2009-2010, Circle Theatre, New Delhi is given a Salary Grant (of 10+1) by the Dept. of Culture, Govt. of India. Apart from the main course of activities the circle theatre organizes symposiums and workshops for its actors by inviting resource person from out side for various facets of theatre from time to time which is related to the productions or the individual growth of actors vis-a- vis a systematic practice and training which the organization runs on its own. Circle Theatre offers workshops for others on various subjects of theatre and being invited especially its Artistic Director Mr. Bapi Bose by the various organizations across the country. The organization attends and participates in various theatre festivals, with the objective of using theatre as an instrument for reaching out to people and creating social awareness while simultaneously educating, entertaining and inspiring the masses. Circle Theatre initiates to promote ‘Young Director’ for new idea of production. The organization provides the ‘Technical Support’ with their excellent technical team to other organizations whenever it is needed. Circle Theatre is a collaborator and an architect of reviving the city’s Bengali theatre culture by involving Sangeet Natak Akademy, New Delhi with New Delhi Kali Bari, Mandir Marg for organizing the National Theatre Festival of Short Plays – All India Bengali Short Drama Competition in 2008 onwards which is become a ‘National Event’, a regular cultural feature of city’s cultural life in the month of February after ‘Bharat Rang Mahotsav’ of NSD. For this ‘National event’ apart from organizing the festival, Circle Theatre has its sharing of responsibilities, introduced the ‘Best Production Award’ and ‘People Choice Award’ along with the ‘Exhibition on Theatre’, ‘Book Shop’ for Theatre periodicals and Theatre Books, ‘Ambience Design’ of the Festival and a ‘Gala Show’ for Prize Distribution ceremony. The organization does humanitarian work for theatre artistes and others in distress. It brings together actors, writers, set-designers, technicians, singers, puppeteers, graphic, designers, video artistes, film producers, cartoonists and musicians, all of whom comprise its core creative team. In spite of its penetrating appeal to the audience, it has always been difficult to run a professional theatre group like ours. However, with our limited resources we have managed to collect 2000 books on theatre, some of which are really rare. These will be useful for a resource centre on theatre with collection of Books, CDs, Photographs, Interviews etc., which we dream to build with assistance from govt. and other interested agency. THE PRODUCTIONS :- The organization is having a unique record of having five productions which have been judged as Best Productions by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi or participated in various festivals including NSD’s International Theatre Festival, called Bharat Rang Mahotsav or International Satellite Theatre Festival of NSD. Socrates (2002) - It is based on Socrates, the great philosopher. It’s a contemporary assessment of Autocracy, Freedom of Thought, Freedom of Expression and again upholding the sanctity of Democracy, law & judiciary, communal harmony and national integration. It had the honour of having the premier as the Venue Opening production at 4th ‘Bharat Rang Mahotsav’, 2002 etc. Julius Caesar Ke Aakhri Saat Din (2003) & revival in 2008 - A play against Autocracy, War in comparison to the sanctity of Democracy, based on the Great dictator Julius Caesar. It questions about the defence of the country, the society, the culture, the religion, the democracy, the independence and the human rights. But upon establishing in the power the leaders forget the welfare of the people and the society – the human rights are killed first instead. Then what is the way out of such predicament for human society? In the last 2000 years all ‘Caesars’ are busy building their ‘personal property much than anything else. Participated in international theatre festival, 10th ‘Bharat Rang Mahotsav’, 2008 etc. Ekla Chalo Re (2004) - A play on partition, Gandhi’s assassination and following incidents. Now half a century after that eventful moment we are once again at the arc of a dramatic historical moment where the divisive forces are raising their heads all over again. Introspection of those events in this dramatic work acts as a reminder for those who cares fort the unity of the country and for those who do not care. It talks about the communal harmony and the national integration.

Pratham Parth (2006) - – Based on dexterous episode of Mahabharat and a subaltern introspection of Karn, the Great warrior. If Karn’s childhood would have been normal, well nurtured, the story of Mahabharat would have been different. The premise is it’s a case of lost childhood so take care of your little child don’t push them away. Best Production by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi, participated in international theatre festival - 9th ‘Bharat Rang Mahotsav’, 2007 and its ‘Satellite Theatre Festival’ participated in Best Plays of the Year, 2007 organized by Sahitya Kala Parishad; Govt of NCT; Delhi etc. Parampurush (2008) - A contemporary introspection of Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsadev, the embodiment of the harmony of world religions and Swami Vivekananda. The play looks into the man who could transform the mutual hatred to mutual love with the philosophy of Shiv Gyan Me Jeev Seva. Nothing could resist him to preach that Lord Shiva is living in the souls of the every human being. Now despite of Ramakrishna’s unique message after ‘Mumbai blast’ the message of the play becomes so relevant to the Indian society especially and as well as the Global terrorism too.

In the last twenty one years, ANANT has many achievements to its credit. First and foremost, it has established itself as a leading exponent of children’s theatre in Delhi—producing plays by and for children; conducting workshops for young, teachers and educators both in schools and communities; working in villages, slums and resettlement colonies; and linking theatre and arts to education and pedagogy. Plays created by ANANT are unique, using culture friendly traditions like play-rhymes, folk narrative traditions like kathavachan and kissa-goi, visual communication through puppetry and pat-katha; and the techniques of storytelling. Some of its well known plays in Hindi are Gadbadjhala (Topsy Turvy), Raja ki Khoj (In Search of a King), Kisse (A Tale of Tales), Chhutti (Freedom), Gopi Gawaiya Bagha Bajaiya (Gopi the Singer Bagha the Drummer) and Liyaram Diyaram. Most of these are original plays, created through workshops with ANANT actors. Many of these plays have participated in numerous festivals in India and abroad. Gadbadjhala, based on collection of rhymes from the Hindi belt, was published by education department of the University of Delhi as resource book with audio support in the form of a cassette. ANANT is in the process of editing some of its original plays for publication. ANANT has conducted innovative school projects by way of using theatre for theme exploration, and subsequent theatrical presentations involving the entire school. The school projects of Presentation Convent and Swai Man Singh School of Jaipur are worth mentioning. ANANT has also conducted an experimental project called Heritage Theatre in the National Museum wherein Harrapa Gallary was explored by educationally marginalised street children with a production and exhibition as the end result. ANANT has also produced adult plays from time to time. Two such productions in Bengali are considered by many critics as unique contributions—Kathokatay Agomani (Homecoming) and Manasa Katha (Legend of Manasa). Whether in children theatre or adult plays, ANANT puts lot of emphasis on research and originality. ANANT has participated in national and international festivals, exchange programmes, and had conducted workshops and submitted papers for seminar all over. Some of these are: Jashne Bachpan and Bharat Rang Mahotsav organised by the National School of Drama in New Delhi, Folk Festival of Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, Surya Festival in Cochin, DALA Festival in Seoul, and AYA Exchange programme in Kuala Lumpur. ANANT is one of the founding members of ASSITEJ India, the gateway national centre of ASSITEJ International which is spread over 80 countries, connecting thousands of theatre groups and persons working in the specialised area of theatre for children and young people. Following the establishment of ASSITEJ India in 2004, ANANT’s director, Dr. Ashish Ghosh, has been invited to participate in ASSITEJ World Congress in Montreal, International Directors’ Seminar in Hamburg, and as International Observer in NEW VOICE/NEW VISION project in Kennedy Center of Washington DC. ANANT is poised for major events, both national and international, in 2011.","DELHI,","Art & Culture,","DELHI->Central, East, New Delhi, North, North East, North West, South, South West, West,",New Delhi,Registered Societies (Non-Government),DELHI,,,Registrar of Societies,S/19564,"E-832, Chittaranjan Park, New Delhi- 110019",ANANT  An Association for Nascent art and Natural Theatre,03-01-1989,,,,,,Dr,anantheatre@gmail.com,9810823354,Ranbir,bose.ranbir@gmail.com,9810150885,,,,,,,,,,Rajesh,rajeshdarshan@gmail.com,9968723515

BLANK VERSE,http://,9830736872,WB/2011/0040788,033-24932262,raja.theatre@gmail.com,,"Blank Verse, though younger in age and experience, feels that the present Youth is by and large trapped in a paradoxical situation as he finds himself increasingly engulfed by the dark forces of Obscurantism, Disintegration and Violence. Pathetically true, he is somehow confused without idealism, traumatized with terror, and listless about his responsibility. On the one hand, he is being continuously misled to understand his own Origin, thanks to the open sky ‘mass culture’; he is being robbed off his own creative passion by the overwhelming panic of terrorism. On the other, scientific and technological openings are challenging him to take up the cudgel and a creative leap into the 21st century. In more specific cultural terms, the Youth is confronted with the choice between re-discovery of his tradition and identity in the modern context and a passive surrender to this present socio-political milieu. In this circumstance, it is our pious task to help the Youth believe in themselves, to help them analyze and understand the world around and its changeability, to help them achieve some creative passion, to help them reach some awareness about our age old Culture, Art & Philosophy, to bring back their confidence that they can really control their own lives and are capable of changing their environment, to help them become the AGENTS OF THE FUTURE. Blank Verse is working regularly with children & elders, coming from various lifestyles, for a couple of years. Then the dream of practicing Theatre has cropped up. Our first production, FURRUT, based on a story by Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury, premiered in the Odeon’06 by Hutchison Telecom Ltd., the play has taken part in Jasnebachpan, 2006 by the T. I. E. Company of National School of Drama, Banga Sanskriti Utsav by the Presidency College Alumni Association, Mumbai, Nandikar’s National Theatre Festival’06, Natyamela ’06 of the Govt. of West Bengal and also in the every major theatre festival in West Bengal. Everywhere the play stole the show and collected an immense audience support. The second play, Kanaichand Palowan allows us to form a new kind of theatre on the square of proscenium. Running regularly at Kolkata successfully, the play has also partaken in Jasnebachpan, 2008, by the T. I. E. Company of National School of Drama, New Delhi, and various children theatre fests around the state. Bhootum Bhagaban, the third play basically emphasizes on the power of truth and belief. The play has been premiered in Jasnebachpan, 2009, by the T. I. E. Company of National School of Drama, New Delhi and also locally at Kolkata in Odeon’09, organized by Vodafone Essar East Limited. The play also has partaken in Visva Bharati Theatre Festival, Shantiniketan in last spring and collected rare applause. The play, Aal Izz Well is on the issue of Juvenile Offence, where we are trying to find our responsibility of being elder and importance of being earnest. We are trying hard to communicate the pangs and agony of Children of some obscure darkness.

But the performance of a State so far as constitutional obligations to their Citizens are far from satisfactory. One can not blame the failures of performances entirely on the Government shoulders alone. In this age of globalisation, Government is found to be overburdened despite their sincere desire and will to translate their ideas and responsibilities into action. There remain always a huge gap between the Government and the people so far as benefits of the welfare State to make them reachable to the just destination. Instances may be cited from the various fields of Governmental activities where Government can not serve properly according to the defined objectives of this State. As for example: Rural Sanitation, Health & Hygiene, Micro-financial benefits, Universal education, Womwn trafficking, Early marriage, Child abuse and many others. Without people’s active and meaningful participation, no Government can claim their success for the aforesaid programmes. Here comes the necessity of forming NGOs for implementation of Government programmess and constitutional obligation towards the citizen. A Nation can not achieve their goal entirely by the Government machineries alone. The gap between the shortcomings of the Government and welfare of the Nation should be narrowed to the desired end by the activities of NGOs. NGOs can play a very big and effective role to create a prosperous Nation by their sincere participation in various nation-building activities. Nation-building activities does not necessarily mean only physical welbeing of the people. The word,‘Nation Building’ include man-making activities too. Only a perfect man can do justice to the welbeing of the Nation. The NGOs should take allout attempts to link their activities with man-making mission positively without which the result of the Developmental programmes will bound to suffer. With each of the activities of NGOs, the true human approach should be linked up, if NGOs want to play a big and successful role to the nation-building activities to which our NGO, Boys’ Recreation Club, is engaged at present. The Boys’ Recreation Club started functioning in 1965 with the sole object of all round development of village, the detailed description of which has been embodied in the Club Constitution. The Boys’ Recreation Club is a registered Organisation under the Society Registration Act of the Government of West Bengal on 10th january, 1980 and also attain the Registration of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976 of the Ministry of Home Affairs under Government of India on 28th February, 2008. Since it’s formation, the Club started functioning and atpresent involved in several socio- economic activities which are not only limited within the village where the club building situated but is spread far and wide. Since it’s formation BRC has played a pivotal role in performing various social activities specially among the poor, distressed and the backward classes of the society like schedule Caste / schedule Tribes in Cooch Behar district. The organisation is engaged in performing humantarian services with an aim to extricate poverty and illiteracy from the poor, neglected and other deprived sections of the society and to provide various welfare measures for these people through multidimensional and socio-economic activities in order to improve and elevate their living standard. It has been a constant endeavour of some highly enthusiastic and light minded people to form a nonprofit making organisation to extend extensive services among the socially, backward and economically deprived section of the society. The organisation is committed to empower the people and facilitate the process of their self-reliance. The thrust of BRC on the issues are : I) all round development of village through socio-economic activities, ii) To build capacity, social responsisbility & to promote income generating programme. Iii) To empower rural people sicially and economically by upgrading their condition iv) Organising the unorganised people and stregthening the existing people’s Organization and Self Help Group.

We feel that this is the first thing we need to say about ourselves. ‘Pancham’, which is ‘fifth’ in English, refers primarily to what is often called the ‘fifth veda’ – the theory of drama by the sage, Bharata. We aim to rediscover the classical and folk roots of Indian theatre. The five fingers on a hand are not all of the same length, but this variety can be a source of strength. Whether we are five or five hundred, here the big and the little come together and work together- the basis of our strength and well-being. This is what Tagore thinks about the number five, as he describes his hero Amit in the novel Shesher Kobita: ‘There is something special in his appearance – he isn’t just any one of a group of five, he is rather absolutely the fifth, and attracts the greatest attention, to the detriment of others.’ Pa, the fifth note of the octave, is almost indispensable in all forms of Indian music. We dream about and work towards a future when any discussion of Indian theatre shall find us a small but indispensable part of its history. Regarding our Work Staging sixty-odd plays in twenty three years ourselves, we also organise Chhotoder Natoker Ekdin Pratidin, -One day theatre in education workshop for students. Over a period of twenty three years, we have worked with students from about hundred institutes ranging from primary schools to graduate colleges to help them to act, put them on stage, enrolled them in drama clubs. The regular Creativity & Personality Development Workshop in schools is named as Srishtisukh. To encourage them further, we have organised inter-school drama competitions, under a programme named Tiner Talowar. Organized Shishutirtha - seven days summer camp for students & Bado Hawa Khub Bhul - an open forum with child-psychologists and guardians for a healthy generation. We have been helping the challenged persons in behavioral therapy through theatre at a home called Anandolok. Besides, we’ve experience to work in a long phase with the lifers for their rehabilitation at Dum Dum Central Correctional Home. We have brought together rural folk artists and street drama groups in our Folk Culture Festivals. For twenty straight years, we have been putting on the annual Darshaker Darbar, a unique drama festival in Bengali where the director must face the audience after the show and answer their questions. There is even a prize for one who asks the best question. We have prepared and produced plays on topical subjects, for the specific needs of social work organizations ranging from education to environment, health issues to psychology, women’s problems to child labor & the same for commercial organizations as well. We have produced a bunch of professional theatre artists, put up a unique stage for theatre-on-demand, put together an essential collection of audio cassettes, compact discs, projector slides, movies, books and magazines, published two well-received and critically acclaimed books, established a forum for the discussion and practice of modern, scientific techniques of theatre. We have carved out a free area for children – Tapoban, to learn about the environment and contemplate about their learning. It offers free-form education for children, and aims to supplement the school curriculum with allied arts. Under the Parichay programme, we look for new talents who show promise in these fields. Our success is evident in the fact that those who represent the teaching and driving force of our group today were once recruited here as trainees.","ANDHRA PRADESH, KARNATAKA, MAHARASHTRA, WEST BENGAL, testingswss, WEST BENGAL,","Aged/Elderly,Art & Culture,Children,Civic Issues,Differently Abled,Disaster Management,Dalit Upliftment,Drinking Water,Education & Literacy,Environment & Forests,Human Rights,Labour & Employment,Minority Issues,Prisoner's Issues,Science & Technology,Tribal Affairs,Urban Development & Poverty Alleviation,Water Resources,Women's Development & Empowerment,Youth Affairs,","ANDHRA PRADESH->Hyderabad, KARNATAKA->Bangalore, MAHARASHTRA->Mumbai, WEST BENGAL->Bankura , Barddhaman , Birbhum, testingswss->, WEST BENGAL->Hugli , Maldah , Purba Medinipur, Murshidabad , Nadia , North Twenty Four Parganas, Puruliya, South Twenty Four Parganas, Paschim Medinipur, Kolkata,",Kolkata,Registered Societies (Non-Government),WEST BENGAL,,,Registrar of Societies,S/80673,"67 N.S.D.

Centre For Holistic Development CHD,http://chdindia.org.in,9811327037,DL/2014/0083170,011-41084099,centreforholisticdevelopment@gmail.com,,"In 2011, Centre for Holistic Development-CHD emerged in Delhi as one of the few ‘on the street’ workers working with the homeless Citizen’s with an emphasis on leadership and capacity building within the homeless community. Prior experience of anchoring the UNDP survey on homeless people in Delhi in 2010 equipped the now formed CHD to take its work forward. Though based in Delhi CHD aspires to work all over India in the coming future. CHD aims to build a self sustainable environment of community care and social inclusion for Homeless Citizens through a rights based approach ensuring a better quality of life. It works towards building safe, community care giving spaces for the homeless citizens through increased participation by establishing their identity as citizens and ensuring access to shelter, food, health, hygiene, safety, privacy, legal powers and freedom from oppression and violence. Scope of work: We have managed, in our short term, to work in all 11 revenue districts in Delhi touching a population of over 80,000 people approximately of the 1.5 lakh homeless population of the city. This includes all areas of public transactions like railways, bus stops and markets. We also work with 5000 porters all over Delhi, in their work and living areas and plan to scale this work to porters all over India. Presently CHD is involved with ‘on street’ night vigilance accompanied with aid and emergency services. These interventions span over the following themes while engaging with urban poverty. A crucial aspect of CHD’s work is the night vigilance that it does to ensure security of and aid provision to the homeless citizens. Aid can be in terms of provision of immediate food and shelter, medical aid, legal aid, intervention with the police or emergency aid depending on the situation. At the present moment CHD reaches out to three emergency interventions per day. Since December 2013, 10 pregnant and lactating women have been provided with shelter, 10 children have been put under shelter care through the CWC and 5 homeless women have been repatriated with their families. Given the nature of work being situational CHD maintains a network with 80,000 homeless citizens and works towards their day to day needs. Need for Night Vigil: Going by government records there are many seasonal deaths and the number tolls higher every year. CHD in collaboration with SAM-BKS took out a report on the basis of the night vigils conducted which estimated the death toll on Delhi streets as follows: - Between 1st September 2013 to 23rd January 2014 to be 1113, most of whom were homeless. - Between 1st April 2013 to 30th June 2013 to be 835 which has risen to 935 deaths during the same time frame in 2014. The report elucidating winter deaths compelled the NHRC to send out a notice to the Delhi Government. At the time the Delhi Government erected 70 more shelters in response during the winter. However, the number of shelters are not even close to addressing the issue of homelessness or the needs of the homeless citizens.","DELHI,","Art & Culture,Civic Issues,Differently Abled,Dalit Upliftment,Drinking Water,Health & Family Welfare,HIV/AIDS,Housing,Human Rights,Legal Awareness & Aid,Labour & Employment,Micro Finance (SHGs),Minority Issues,Prisoner's Issues,Right to Information & Advocacy,Rural Development & Poverty Alleviation,Vocational Training,Women's Development & Empowerment,Any Other,","DELHI->Central, East, New Delhi, North, North East, North West, South, South West, West,",Delhi,Registered Societies (Non-Government),DELHI,,,Registrar of Societies,S/00280-NE/2010-11,"Sunil Kumar Aledia, Centre For Holistic Development-CHD 1D, First Floor, Shahpur Jat New Dellhi-49 email:-centreforholisticdevelopment@gmail.com Office:91 11 4108 4099 Mobile91 9811327037",Centre For Holistic Development CHD,11-05-2011,The Society Registration Act1860,,Abdul Salam,abdulsalammidday@gmail.com,9711035786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To carry forward the glorious heritage that he left before us, Saheed Shibsankar Seba Samity has its foundation on May 23, 1978. Objects: SSSS is not another hospital or a V.O where curative health care is usually offered to ailing people.

That is why SSSS is striving to evolve all the constituents of a comprehensive health care delivery where the main emphasis is on unleashing popular initiative for social action. It also attempts to act as an inter-face-agency between the ailing people and the curative centers. The meager curative services SSSS provides help also to develop a bondage with the people in distress. The preventive health programs that SSSS adheres to are basically a three way scheme-(i) Early Detection of illness in a particular community and Identification of the underlying causes (ii) Immunization against some recognized diseases which take a great toll of life and (iii) Health Education. SSSS Strives to: Assist and Co-operate with the Central and State Govt. in all its health care efforts:  Provide minimum curative services to the ailing people.  Organize awareness campaign on AIDS, TB, Thalassaemia , Cancer, Blindness control  Running a NACO Assisted Licensed Blood Bank as per rules and specifications to provide safe blood to the needy.  Running MNGO Scheme in Burdwan District under RCH-II to provide Mother& Child care program in the remote rural areas.  Awareness campaign, identifying causes of common diseases like malaria, encephalitis, gastro-enteritis , Dengue, Viral Hepatitis, Bird flu, Swine flu & other viral diseases , Leprosy  Organize seminars, workshops with help of posters, models, LCD projectors, OHP, on air and water pollution, safe drinking water, sanitation, nutrition, drug addiction, personal & area cleanliness, healthy habits, against superstition & promotion of scientific attitudes.  Organize Health checkup Camps for Primary, Nursery & Adolescents girls in secondary schools.

Economic Rural Development Society,,9831654430,WB/2009/0008517,033-22486888,erdskol@gmail.com,,"Achievement: This strong association between the functionaries of ERDS and the local youth club members was based on a common zeal and understanding to improve the quality of life in the villages. This association clicked so effectively every where that the local youth became the ‘Torch – bearer’ for the functionaries. In fact, most of the difficulties faced by the functionaries’ at the initial stages were sorted out with the help of local youth club members only. The most effective and meaningful role in involving the community in the process of bringing about improved quality of life was played by none other than the children of the project areas. ERDS, undoubtedly, has been able to attract the attention of all types of community leaders – the Panchayet members, traditional caste/community leaders, religious leaders, political leaders, school teachers, women groups, youth club etc. to the sponsorship program and its benefits. ……………As a sequel to the efforts made by one and all as stated above, there now exits a sense of togetherness among the villagers, their readiness to change and their conscious efforts to take up collective action on such issues which affect their lives. This has been the most crucial achievement of the sponsorship program as well as ERDS. There is no doubt that this is the beginning of the community empowerment process and the beginning has been well initiated. The rest is naturally assured. For ERDS, the concept of community participation is never a ‘borrowed’ or ‘imposed’ concept; rather it is ingrained in the organizational building process. The Chief Functionary who has established and nurtured ERDS as an organization for ‘working with the people’ has, because of his praise – worthy personal characteristics and tremendous leadership skills, emerged as a role model for voluntary workers. The forms and strategies of communication adopted by the functionaries in communicating with the people have proved to be very effective and meaningful in motivating the people. Judicious use of folk media such as plays, puppet-shows etc. has attractive the attention of the people in a very encouraging way. In addition, the personality traits showed by the functionaries such as simplicity, cordiality, personal touch, displaying respect and dignity to the people, taking people into confidence, listening to their problems etc. have played a crucial role in facilitating community participation. The mechanism for supervision as followed by ERDS disserves all praise as it is absolutely based on mutual trust and respect – not the one which is normally found in an organizational set up.

It also presented different programmes of other dance forms at our own Padatik Cultural Centre Auditorium and elsewhere. It presented its programmes at various venues in Kolkata and other cities too. April 2013 to June 2013 • We have carried forward our production “Mukta Mon” from last year. It bears a vital message of Tagore, the man, rarest of rare who has sought freedom of the human heart so passionately that his free spirit as a liberated human mind ever enriched our heart. This year “Mukta Mon” was staged on 5th May 2013 at our auditorium. • On 30th June 2013, we had staged our new production “Some Dots”. • On 2013 “Khudito Pashan” had staged in Satayajit Ray auditorium Kolkata. It is the form of a truly lavish musical which has been performed all over India as part of prominent festivals, cooperative events, etc. This enigmatic story was first brought to the silver screen as a Bengali movie and then as “Lekin” by Gulzar, starring Vinod Khanna & Dimple Kapadia. October 2013 to December 2013 On 14th December 2013, Padatik Cultural Centre presented two dance pieces “Flight of Birds” and “Scarlett of Love” organised by West Bengal State Music Academy at Uday Shankar Dance Festival at Rabindra Sadan Auditorium, Kolkata. • “Flight of Birds”, a musical piece of 20 minutes duration is a story of a family of birds; father, mother and their four children. Changes of their lives are depicted with the changing of seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter. It is choreographed by Dietmar Seyffert of Germany and its music is given by Pt. Vijai Shankar. The innovative choreography has been recently revived and it features different dance movements of Kathak, Chhau and Ballet. • Our new production, “Scarlett of Love” whose music was given by Mr. Mayukh Bhowmick explores the mystery of love. Mr. Mayukh Bhowmick is a renowned composer for experimental films as well as music compositions. He has been commissioned to work on a music piece which is appealing to our present day audience yet keeping our tradition alive. The Repertory dancers worked hard for this fusion piece taking out each note in the music with subtle movements. January 2014 to March 2014 Two new most important productions of PCC this year include “Angvinyasam” and “Ityalam” presented on 29thJanuary 2014 at Kamani Auditorium, New Delhi. It was presented by our North-east students. All our north-east dancers are excellently trained in Ballet and Classical Jazz Techniques.

Female infanticide is not uncommon in Indian society, and is still prevalent in certain parts of the country .With the advancement of modern technology is practice, however, has taken a different shape. Now it is possible to detect the sex of the baby when it is still in the womb of the mother. This has made it possible to abort the female fetus, if is unwanted. Even in economically prosperous states like Orissa the sex ratio has dramatically declined, it is 875 in Orissa , down from 800 in 1991, of the 10 district in the country where the sex ration has fallen below 850, three belong to Orissa . A declining sex ratio is an alarming social signal. In the natural order of things, the number of females born should slightly exceed that of males. Female’s infanticide whether by underfeeding, poisoning or suffocating contributes to a skewed sex ratio? The availability of sex determination tests makes the situation worse. Couples normally hesitant to carry out infanticide (after a child is born) find it easier to opt for medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) which is legal.

Some of the major achievements are: • 2 boys represented India (Under- 14 )at the AFC Championships 2010 in Iran. • Finished 5th in the prestigious Kokkola Cup in Finland – July 2007.

As such, to combat this menace, a Counselling Centre known as NEW HOPE DE- Addiction cum Counselling Centre at Central Ward, Shillong. The Centre has 15 beds and is giving free treatment to chemical dependent who come and register themselves for counselling, awareness and rehabilitation . The Centre also run an HIV/AIDS cell in the centre with a full Field Worker to conduct awareness programmes on the basics of HIV/AIDS and preventives measures. The centre has also a branch mainly focus to Female Sex Worker (FSW) infected with HIV/AIDS known as SAINDUR THYMMAI, at Nongpoh Ri Bhoi District.

Indian Academy for Self Employed Women,http://www.sewaacademy.org,9825415062,GJ/2016/0099855,079-26577115,sewaacdy@bsnl.in,,"The Indian Academy for Self Employed Women (IASEW) or SEWA Academy is a sister organisation of SEWA (Self Employed Women’s Association) based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Initiated by SEWA as an activity in 1991, IASEW got registered as an autonomous charity trust in 2005 and has been since trying to make itself sustainable. IASEW is the focal point for all of training, capacity-building, research and communication efforts. IASEW functions as our members’ “university”, introducing the poor informal sector women to formal learning environment. IASEW primary objective is to take the poor informal sector women’s movement forward. It does this in four ways - through training and capacity-building, action-oriented research focusing on poor women members, and by building strong communication channels, within the organization as well as with the outside world. 1. Training; IASEW’s trainings are driven by the core belief that everyone has potential and ability. The training programmes are a collective approach to overall development of women and the capacity- building programmes cut across all the requirements. The programmes help to develop women’s self-esteem, confidence and leadership skills. The expertise from SEWA’s sister organizations, which are autonomous but integrated, enriches the training programmes and vice versa. 2. Research; IASEW has been involved in research related work since the inception of SEWA in 1972. Thus, IASEW’s Research division was setup in the year 1991. The research conducted at IASEW always had its focus on the poor self employed, on their present living conditions, challenges and struggles. Ours is an action-oriented approach to make an impact at the policy level. 3. Literacy; The women participating in trainings provided by IASEW were both literate and illiterate, from different areas of city and villages. The illiterate women said: ‘We would like to study’! The enthusiasm led to the initiation of Literacy Classes in 1992. The members sought education, which was easy to understand and which would help them in life. Mobile Van: The Mobile Van was started on 3 October 2009. Equipped with video, CDs on issues related to poor informal sector, and Megaphone, the Mobile Van visits the people in their neighbourhoods and arranges replays of video and radio. Library: Libraries have been set up in working class areas. This was initiated from February 2003. Akashganga Club: Akashganga is a magazine for young girls, initiated by IASEW. The variety of activities undertaken by the club are story-telling, hygiene education, adolescent fairs, stage shows, sports day and cultural programmes, festival related programmes, fancy dress competition, exposure trips to science city, and Gandhi ashram. Cultural Programmes: Cultural programmes are organized to present the talent of community women and girls. 4. Communication; Communication plays a very crucial role in the lives of poor women workers. There is a great need for communication, between self employed women, and between them and the public, policy planners, and other government officials. The different print media of communication are Anasooya, Akashganga, E-newsletter, and electronic media of communication are Video SEWA and Rudi no Radio.","GUJARAT,","Children,Education & Literacy,Vocational Training,Women's Development & Empowerment,","GUJARAT->Ahmadabad, Anand , Banas Kantha, Gandhinagar, Kachchh, Kheda, Mahesana, Patan , Sabar Kantha, Surat, Surendranagar, Vadodara, Tapi,",Ahmedabad,Trust (Non-Government),GUJARAT,,041910386,Charity Commissioner,E/17298/Ahmedabad,"Indian Academy for Self Employed Women (IASEW) Krishna Bhuvan, SEWA Academy, Opp. Sakar - II, Ellis Bridge Corner, Town Hall,",Indian Academy for Self Employed Women,01-09-2005,"At office of Public Trust Registrar,Ahmedabad",,,,,Shantaben KoshtiI,shanta.sewaacdy@gmail.com,9712040344,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
